#Lighting


##Recommendations: 

* UVB bulb (Reptisun T5 high output or Arcadia 14% T5 HO) 
* 3-4 60/65W-90W halogen flood bulbs par38

**Example:**  

8x4x4 enclosure: 3-4 rowed lighting fixtures, 2ft above substrate surface, using 60/65W halogen flood bulbs should give you surface readings of 130F+. Most people use par30 or par38 flood bulbs. UVB strip should be placed along side basking bulbs so that while the monitor basks it also gets UVB exposure. Some people place in middle of enclosure. The objective is to space so that the light/heat output is uniform and provides large surface area coverage

##Understand Lighting

 by jordan spring

Reptiles and amphibians need both UVB and UVA light to live healthy lifestyles. These are both types of ultraviolet (and UV) light. Each type of light has a different role to play in keeping your pet happy and healthy. The UV spectrum is broken up into three parts: UVA, UVB and UVC. All three of these types of light are found in sunlight.

* UVA light helps regulate behaviors such as feeding, diurnal movement, mating and similar activities.
* UVB light allows the synthesis of vitamin D3, which helps to absorb calcium.
* UVC light is not required for reptiles, but it can help kill bacteria. It’s important to note that at high levels of exposure this light can be harmful to most animals.

UV wavelengths are filtered by glass and plastic, so to get the most out of your bulbs be sure they have direct exposure to the habitat. Over time UV output will diminish. We recommend replacing your fluorescent bulbs every 3,500 hours or around 12 months.

A wild reptile may spend many hours a day basking in the sun, absorbing ultraviolet (UV) light; these wavelengths of light are necessary for the body to manufacture the vitamin D3 it needs for proper calcium absorption from the intestines. Vitamin D3is manufactured in the skin. Failure to provide UV light can predispose your pet to nutritional metabolic bone disease, an overly common condition of pet reptiles that is fatal if not recognized and treated.

the light should be within 6-12 inches from the animal in order for the pet to receive any benefit.
The amount of light your reptile receives each day (called the photoperiod) is very important. Photoperiod and temperature will generally decrease in the winter and increase in the summer. Failure to account for these changes in captivity results in problems in pet reptiles. Reproductive failure is the most common symptom and is especially problematic for females who may develop ovarian problems or chronic yolk resorption. Obesity can also develop with incorrect photoperiod as animals that are normally less active in the winter months will continue to eat at a summer pace.

Photoperiods have a greater seasonal variability the further away from the equator a reptile's native environment is.

Electric timers can aid the regulation of photoperiod in captivity, and more closely mimic the reptile's natural photoperiod. Remember, your pet reptile cannot sense the change of seasons occurring outside your home. As a general guideline, allow for 14 - 15 hours of light in the summer and 10 - 12 hours of light in the winter, depending on the zone of the animal's native environment. This is especially important in breeding situations
