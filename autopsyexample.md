# DISSECTION 

by Dean Cheetham

* 6-7yr old Female exanthematicus which passed 82 days after laying. Aug 1st 2019

* Believed cause - blood filled mass In abdomen - "possibly blood filled ovarian cyst" unfortunately no histology testing was performed to confirm exact COD.

* 2 owners prior to my care.

* SVL - 33cm

* TL - 75cm (missing tail tip)

* Weight - 1296g

* Filled mass weight - 52g

* Drained mass weight - 32g

* Fat stores - 217g (10%)

Try to remember she had at least 2 owners before me, so I know little of her previous care.

The liver was found to have some discoloration. "Blotching". Oviducts where distended and showed sign of use. Ovaries and follicles were small. Stomach appeared to be some what "full" but were not examined. (Last food item was a rodent and Dubai roaches)

The mass was found in the abdomen, between the liver and one of the oviducts I believe.

Stompys rear claws were brittle and not in the best of shape. Cant say why, perhaps a lack of calcium or UV possibly as a youngster and came to light in her latter years.. She had an old injury to 1 of her toes, possibly from losing a claw in the past. For size reference the squares on the paper are 5mm squared.
