Natural disaster happen, we don’t always know when they will happen, so we need to be prepared. It is a good idea to have a safety plan in place for not only the human members of your family but for your pets as well.

Keep an emergency container (this should be something water and fire resistant/proof) with important documentation. 

### This should include:

* a list of your animals, their species, color and any special characteristics. 

* Proof of ownership: purchase papers, veterinary records, photos, microchip paperwork

* Have a light weight, escape proof container for each of your reptiles.  Make sure there are holes for ventilation, but not large enough for escapes

* Have warming and cooling packs

* Have a reptile first aid 

* Call emergency management officials to obtain a list of “pet friendly” emergency shelters

* Keep a permanent notice, prominently displayed, that there are pets on the premises for emergency workers

* Keep a list of hotels/motels that are “pet friendly” in the area that you plan to evacuate to

* Consider a permanent form of identification such as microchipping (make sure that you register with the company, and notify them of any changes immediately)

* Invest in a generator

* Make sure to have sufficient water stored for you animals

If you are able and willing to evacuate your feeders do so, otherwise try to move them to a high, dry and safe area prior to evacuating. You can remove fresh vegetables, greens, fruits from your refrigerator and add to feeder bins. This gives them a food supply in your absence, as well as reduces the amount of spoilage in your fridge
If you are friendly with a neighbor or have someone local that you trust: provide your contact information, provide them with a notice of permission to enter your home incase of emergency, a copy of your emergency plan and a copy of your list of animals/their locations.  This is incase an emergency occurs when you are out of town or not at home.

### OTHER NOTES: 

List scars Mark's and other identifiers

If you must leave the animals somewhere at a facility or whatnot leave your contact emergency contact as well as vet contact info.

If you will be without power make water bottles prior enough to last 4 weeks is suggested varying on what type of disaster.

If any animals escape notify local agency in charge of wildlife. Especially if you are in Florida notify fwc or any escapes. DNR is most states I believe.

Always have a backup person listed that can care for your animals if you become hurt or anything else during a natural disaster.

If you cannot take your animals or find a pet friendly area or pet friendly shelters are full, find a friend or trustworthy person who can hold them and care for them during the situation.
