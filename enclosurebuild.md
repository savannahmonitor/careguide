by JENIFER SOLIDA

This is a basic build guideline:

Common ways to seal your enclosure:

Line plywood with FRP (fiberglass reinforced plastic) panels. Cut and pre-fit FRP panels. Spread wall adhesive (liquid nails FRP adhesive) with trowel over entire back of panel. As soon as adhesive spread over entire panel and before adhesive skins over (within 45 min), set panel in position and press against wood. DIY helpful hint: going over panel once place with a rolling pin help with more even adherence.

Commonly used wood sealants (listed in longest lasting order 1st):

Fiberglass epoxy resin

Fiberglass Polyester resin

Yacht/Sparr Varnish

Drylock

Kennel Seal

All products are non toxic once fully cured. Before introducing substrate or animal please wait for recommended cure time of the individual product and all odors have dissipated.

Something that should always be kept in mind before construction is the amount of weight that your enclosure will add to your floor and supports, the enclosure and substrate can exceed a ton. It is always a good idea to calculate your floor load capacity. There are ways to compensate for the heavier weights like limiting the load in remaining areas, positioning the enclosure so that it is over more than one floor joist, and locating the load near the end of joists. If you are in an older home where joists may be located further in space from each other, then you will have to consider installing additional supports. One story brick homes without a basement or large crawl space would not have the same concerns.
