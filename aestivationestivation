#Aestivation (Estivation)

By JENIFER SOLIDA

There is some confusion over terms for dormancy that are often used in the reptile community and how they related to Savannah Monitors.

The following are terms that you may see come up in discussion of Savannah Monitors and other reptiles in the wild and in captivity.

1. Dormancy: A period in an organismâ€™s life cycle when growth, development, and physical activity slows or ceases
Torpor: a state of physical or mental inactivity; lethargy. Characterized by a cessation of feeding and eventually lack of movement

2. Brumation: a state or condition of sluggishness, inactivity or torpor exhibited by reptiles during winter or extended periods of low temperatures. Triggered by lack of heat and the decrease in hours of daylight

3. Aestivation (estivation): a form of torpor by reptiles in response to heat stress.  To spend a hot/dry season in an inactive, dormant state.  The word derives from the latin for summer (aestas), or heat (aestus) 

When talking about Savannah Monitors, the closest term we have to describing their behavior during the hot/dry season is called aestivation.  The physiology of aestivation is quite different from a term most reptile keepers are familiar with, brumation. There is a wide range  between a reptiles preferred temperature for activity (coenothermic temperature) and the lowest temperature at which it can exist.  Conversely, there is a much more narrow range between a reptiles coenothermic temperature and high temperatures that can cause death.  Simply stated, reptiles can tolerate cooler temperatures much better than they can tolerate higher ones. 

Although there is a considerable interspecific variation in timing mechanisms among reptiles, some general trends are evident. Temperature and lack of available water seem to be the factors that prompt the behavioral change in the Savannah Monitors. In areas in which alternating wet and dry seasons occur, reptiles remain in a longer period of dormancy or torpor during the dry season.  This has shown to be the case with Savannah Monitors observed in field studies, where they exhibit a fasting period and slowed rate of activity from January through June.  During aestivation a monitor can rely on the soil buffered burrow microenvironment to help avoid water loss and avoid the extremes of the surface environment. Daily temperature variations decrease with depth in soil. Below 15 inches there is little to no daily temperature fluctuations.  Specimens are often found high in trees, in shaded, brush areas surrounding trees, in the hollows of trees or deep in burrows in attempts to escape the full sun and sweltering heat.

There are key factors that help Savannah Monitors optimize long term viability during aestivation.  
Simply stated, during the dry season aestivating monitors can reduce metabolism, conserve energy reserves, reduce gas exchange and its inevitable loss of water vapor. 

More specifically:

* Strong metabolic rate suppression (tissue metabolism and cardiac activity become down regulated, mainly by reducing cardiac frequency)

* Strategies to retain body water

* Conservation of energy and body fuel reserves (energy reserves used during aestivation are provided mainly by fats and lipids)

* Altered nitrogen metabolism (increases in CO2, accompanied by reduced O2 levels)

* Mechanisms to preserve and stabilize organs, cells and macromolecules over many months of dormancy (cell signaling is crucial to achieving both hypometabolic state and reorganize multiple metabolic pathways)

How this information applies to captive keeping is still unknown and under evaluated at this time.  Aestivation may be the key to solving many of the issues that Savannah Monitors face in captivity or if a Savannah Monitor is properly supported (ie feeding a well rounded diet based on energy use, not allowing the monitor to become overweight or develop an over abundance of fat storage) throughout the year, prolonged aestivation my be unnecessary.  We simply do not have the answer at this time, thankfully there is more attention being given to this subject and hopefully future owners will have the answer to this.
