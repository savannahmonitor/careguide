# Why understanding, providing and accurately measuring enclosure temperatures is so important

by JENIFER SOLIDA

Savannah Monitors are ectothermic animals. Being an ectotherm means that their body temperature mainly depends on an external heat source. Ectotherms do generate some metabolic heat (heat by locomotion, activity) but they can’t increase this production to maintain a specific internal temperature.

Ectotherms do regulate their body temperature to some degree, it’s just not done by producing their own heat. Instead it is done by different strategies, such as behavior, by activities such as seeking shade, burrowing, seeking exposure to heat (the sun or artificial heating in captivity ie basking lighting) to find the environmental temperature that meets it’s needs. This is called behavioral thermoregulation. 

A Savannah Monitor’s ability to thermoregulate effectively is entirely dependent on access to temperatures within it’s Preferred Optimal Temperature Zone (POTZ). The POTZ is a range of temperatures in which the monitor can perform all necessary metabolic functions. This is an extremely important aspect of captive husbandry. If not provided an appropriate thermal gradient (range of temperatures), the monitor will not be able to thermoregulate efficiently. 

## WHEN TEMPERATURES ARE TOO LOW 

* Digestive issues

* Immune suppression

* Hypothermia: signs are decreased activity and eventually ceasing movement. This is often followed by ceased feeding and drinking, leading to the monitor losing weight and becoming dehydrated. Difficulty in shedding can also occur. Prolonged hypothermia will lead to death. 

##WHEN TEMPERATURES ARE TOO HIGH 

* Forced high metabolic rate causing energy deficits

* Heat stress: rapid breathing, lethargy, refusing food

* Hyperthermia: increase body temperature, fever

* Cardiac damage

* Neurological impairment, seizures, and coma

## PREFERRED BODY TEMPERATURE

Temperatures offered aid in captive Savannah Monitors reaching Preferred Body Temperature (PBT). Savannah Monitor’s suspected PBT is 95F(35). PBT is the core body temperature that is optimal for numerous functions including:

* movement

* digestion

* feeding

* reproduction

* metabolism

* growth

Since Savannah Monitors exchange heat with their environment across their body surface, smaller Sav will tend to heat up to optimal body temperature as well as lose body heat much more quickly than larger Sav in a cooler environment.

The reason why we suggest the higher range of basking surface temperatures is to allow captive Savannah Monitors to be able to reach optimal body temperature in a shorter period of time, this lessens the amount of time the monitor will have to expose itself to the artificial heat source which reduces the risk of thermal burns.

One of the reasons why we suggest the larger enclosure builds is so that owners can provide a larger temperature gradient (POTZ) and besides the physiological benefits of thermoregulation this also offers a psychological benefit of the monitor having more control over it’s environment and exposure to different preferred temperatures (it give the monitor more choices). 
 

# Temperature and Heat for Reptiles
by Roman Muryn

I have been meaning to put a few words together on temperature and light measurement. Before
the measurement of heat is discussed its probably good to understand the physics that generate it.

## What is temperature

From a herpetologists perspective we talk about the temperature in the vivarium and we also talk
about basking temperature as if they were linked, unwittingly we are confusing two different
physical phenomena.

If I cover temperature first then move onto measurement it might make this difficult to write note
more palatable.

Absolutely every physical body, piece of rock, water and even gas has a temperature. That
temperature is referenced to a value defined in 1848 by William Thomson, who later was made
Lord Kelvin, hence degrees K or the Kelvin temperature. He defined that the coldest it ever gets in
the (whole) universe is -2730C (Absolute Zero) the temperature steps in his Kelvin scale were the
same as the centigrade scale; so 273K is the temperature of ice forming (00C) and room temperature
is about 3000K.

Another clever chappie Nicolas Carnot developed the idea that all energy must decay to its lowest
energy state …...this of course must be at zero Kelvin - Absolute Zero. So…… everything in our
world is radiating heat. Yes even the ice, as its trying to cool to Absolute Zero.
When we measure the temperature of something then, we either measure a body that has been
warmed up above Absolute zero or we measure the radiation it gives off. Simples.

## How does the world of the reptile get hot?

Always, but always, the world of the reptile gets hot because of the suns radiation.
The sun shines in the day, whatever it shines on absorbs much of the heat radiated upon it then it reradiates the stored heat when the sun stops shining and when the surrounding air is cooler. After 24
hours the cycle is complete and temperature returns to the start.

Diagram 1: https://imgur.com/IfQOLyp

shows the nature of the radiation from the sun reaching earth. All of the area in yellow
under the curve is light energy which when it hits an object as light loses some energy that then
converts to heat. Assume that for every square metre of earth we get about 1000 watts of radiated
power reaching the dirt. Note that even the visible light carries energy but we don't feel it as heat.

## What is it about the suns radiation that matters.

Different parts of the suns light affect objects differently. Those differences exist because light
comes in different wavelengths. Our eyes are developed/optimised for the rainbow coloured
wavelengths – the visible light but our bodies use the other wavelengths as well and its only in
recent years that we have learned just how much.

## Grouping of wavelengths

Diagram 1 above shows three distinct wavelength groups

* Ultra-Violet light

* Visible light

* Infra-red light

The wavelengths have such a wide dimensional range that each needs a different measuring
approach – a bit like a loudspeaker system needs tweeters, midrange speakers and woofers to
produce the whole spectrum of sound that we hear.
4a Ultra-violet

Ultra-Violet has three groups of wavelengths, however the wavelength UVc is blocked by the ozone
layer and never gets to earth so is not considered here.

UVa and UVb is very short wavelength light which we humans have evolved not to see but many
other animals can. Because it is of a short wavelength it is relatively easy to produce an instrument
to measure by looking at the source. We reptile keepers are most interested in the UVb light
component because it contributes to the production of Vitamin D3. A meter is available to directly
measure this and the preferred instrument is the Solar meter 6.5R.; the units we use are UVi.

### Visible light

This visible light is always considered as light but it does in fact carry energy which is eventually converted to heat.

Diagram 2: https://imgur.com/dRn2BHZ

Diagram 2 shows the sensitivity of the human eye to the various wavelengths, there is clearly a
peak in sensitivity and it means that a red light for example has to be lit with more power for it to be
at the same brightness as green light.

The standard that is used to measure the quantity of light produced by a lamp for human
illumination is defined as Lumens. Lux is just the number of lumens reaching a sq metre target. All
lamps produced must have a statement of their performance on the packaging. Lux meters are freely
available and now apps are available to convert the light sensor in a phone into a light meter. I have
tried a number of them on different phones and they all seem to give consistent answers.
The visible light wavelength is such that it can be measured directly by pointing an instrument at
the light source.

### Infra-Red light

The infra-red light that comprises the longer light wavelengths is also sometimes called Near InfraRed (NIR). NIR starts with just-visible dark red at about 650nm and extends to 1400nm. Because
of this long wavelength, NIR is very challenging to measure directly. Expensive equipment is
required and is beyond the financial capabilities of most keepers.
NIR is just as valuable a light source as UV and visible light and must be provisioned in a vivarium.
Many consider NIR as heat but really it is light and is the transition between light and the much
longer wavelength low grade heat.

This wavelength is analogous to the point where sound is still sound but can also be felt as
vibration.

(NOTE: to read about why red lights are bad click [here.]( reddit.com/r/savannahmonitor/wiki/redlights))

## What do we provide for our animals?

### Background heat

This is heat that is felt throughout a vivarium and may be required to maintain metabolism. This is a
low grade heat operating at very long wavelengths (10 microns or 10000nm). Nominally room
temperature. It is always as a result of secondary re-radiation such as a hot rock or some other
“radiator”. This can also be emulated in a vivarium with a low power heat mat or a ceramic heat
emitter.

### Basking light and heat

In the first instance we must recognize that animals don’t just bask to gain heat.
Here are some reasons for basking, all of which may need some or all of the three kinds of
wavelength which we discussed above.

1. Sheer pleasure.

2. Circadian cycle excitation through the parietal eye.

3. D3 capture through UV

4. Increase metabolism through warmth

5. Use UV and IR for managing Fungal and Bacterial infections

6. Raise temperature to manage viral infections.

7. Use NIR for wound healing

8. Use NIR for deeper heat penetration and heat sinking

9. Use NIR for internal egg and neonate incubation Esp viviparous animals)

10. Digesting food

11. Drying and heating to aid in shedding

12. Parasite management.

You can see from the above list that it is not only the heat element that is important; it is the quality
of total light that we must get right. We can measure UV and visible light easily; these words are
about getting the NIR right.

## Heat Lamps

Before we talk of measuring heat in a vivarium we should understand how it is made. Right at the
start of this note it was stated that all energy comes from the sun.

When any object is irradiated with sunlight some of the light energy is captured by the object being
irradiated. The amount of energy that is captured depends on the objects’ material absorption
properties and its colour - we all know that black absorbs light and reflects very little. The absorbed
light energy is converted to heat and is stored by the object; whilst the suns energy is high the object
will continue to absorb and grow hotter but as soon as the sun stops the object will start radiating
out the absorbed heat but, at a much longer wavelength than the original source of energy.
This is what happens with tarmac roads in warmer climes and why reptile hunting is good after
sunset. The animals that operate at night seek out that asphalt heat source in order to metabolise for
the nights hunt.

This re-radiating of heat produces background heat, some nooks stay warmer but the open flat
surfaces soon cool down and by morning the cycle starts again.

We as hobbyists have no easy tool to measure NIR, what we have to do is to look at the lamp paper
work in the first instance and select the basking lamp based on its technical specifications.
NIR is generated by most incandescent lamps with colour temperatures around the 3000K region
and tungsten halogen lamps are really good examples. They provide light through heating a
tungsten filament to a white hot temperature and releasing photons in the process but most of the 
electrical power is used to make NIR. From the herpetological perspective the less efficient a lamp
is the better a basking lamp for basking.

diagram 4: https://imgur.com/XiY8HAA

Diagram 4 below shows the irradiation curves for tungsten lamps and a professional medical heat
lamp. Such a lamp will produce about 4 lumens per watt used, they do produce a lovely dull red
light useful in basking. Domestic tungsten lamps usually provide over 6 lumens per watt. 

Some manufacturers tweak the design of the tungsten filament such that more NIR is produced than
light, one example on the market produces no light visible to the human eye, however many reptiles
will see the lamp because their colour receptors cover the NIR spectrum as is shown in Diagram 5
below. It follows that if you control the lamp using a pulse controller; we humans may not see the
lamp pulsing but your reptile may. This will be uncomfortable for it. A dimmer should be used.

diagram 5: https://imgur.com/2NMXemj

The guidance here is that the type of light you choose is through selecting the technology.
Tungsten lamps can be dimmed to reduce their power and this can be an effective way of tuning the
lamp to the basking spot, provided that after power reduction the radiating performance of the lamp
is not unduly affected.

diagram 6 https://imgur.com/E82dd6r

For my Bearded Dragon I am using a tungsten lamp and running the temperature of my slate at
450C . That's the temperature the slate is re-radiating at. The Beardie spends several minutes during
the day sitting on it under the lamp often after eating food. He does not stay long. The vivarium
background heat is about 300C. In the wild the rock would easily be 600C at mid-day.

## Measuring temperature

### Bi-metal thermometers

These instruments are as simple as it gets. A strip of metal comprised of two metals of different temperature expansion coefficients are bonded together. As temperature changes one half expands more than the other and deflects a pointer. These can be reliable if not extremely accurate. They should be placed in a ventilated shade spot and will give an indication of the back-ground temperature.
Use them as a canary.

### Thermometers with thermistor sensor (lead)

The comments here also apply to temperature controllers that have a remote sensor. The
measurement sensor is usually a thermistor - an electronic component whose resistance varies with
temperature. When a constant current is passed through it, the voltage across it will vary. That
varying voltage can then be used to provide temperature indication or temperature control.

If it is small and black and just laid onto a rock there is danger that it may absorb heat differently to the substrate and provide a false reading. It should be fixed with good contact with the object being measured. 

diagram 7: https://imgur.com/DVycpgK

Notice the two different readings of the same spot using two different instruments (7b and 7c) The
black shiny remote sensor is not absorbing as much of the heat as the matt slate. If it were fixed
directly on the slate it would probably give a better more accurate reading, gaining heat through
conduction.

Generally if the sensor is placed in good contact with the slate both reading tie up.

 We have talked about colour temperature; that can be directly linked to wavelength though the
following equation, where λ is the wavelength in microns. So the conversion from Colour
temperature to wavelength can easily be done.

The temperature in Kelvin = 2900/λ

### Infra-red thermometers with laser pointer.

Earlier it was stated that every object radiates heat and these instruments actually measure that
radiated heat. They are similar to light sensors in operation but instead of using semiconductor light
sensing diodes they use a thermopile heat sensor as the target. The thermopile has a limited sensing
range from 6000 nm to 14000 nm (1500C to -600C) so it is beyond the range of the light produced
by NIR. We use it to measure the secondary radiated heat from the basking spot. 

The radiated infra red light on the spot target is focused onto the thermopile via a special lens - just like children do with the sun and a magnifying glass. The thermopile generates a small electrical current which is amplified and used to indicate the temperature. 

I advise some caution in the use of these instruments; just as with visible light, different surfaces have different emissivity and so it is with infrared light. Different surfaces may give different readings. The most reliable emissive surfaces are matte black or dark grey substances such as slate or stone and least reliable are shiny metals. 

diagram 8: https://imgur.com/oYbxjiW

### Summary
To summarise when we choose basking arrangements, we start with choosing the lamp that provides the right wavelengths. Then we set up the lamp such that the basking target gets to about 400 or 450 when measured with a thermometer. If you are controlling (dimming) the lamp ensure that the sensor is affixed to the target basking spot without being directly illuminated. Your animals will seek to get warm in the basking spot and will move off when warmed up. If they only bask for very short periods then the setting may be too high. If they stay for ages then the setting may be too low and they are not getting warm enough.

All three wavelength groups are important in the vivarium as they are in the wild.
