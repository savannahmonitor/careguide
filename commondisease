#Common Disease and Disorders of Savannah Monitors
By JENIFER SOLIDA

This document is to aid in providing information on common medical issues of captive Savannah Monitors as a quick reference guide, I will be including other files with detailed information on each that can be referred to as well. The majority of these issues are husbandry related, which is why is it so important to follow correct care guidelines and provide proper husbandry.

##OBESITY

Most common health concerns of Savannah Monitors are caused by obesity. Savannah Monitors have a voracious appetite. Pet owners have a tendency to overfeed this appetite. This combined with the reduced activity levels commonly seen in captive Savannah Monitors  and lack of correct temperatures, obesity occurs. 

In the wild Savannah Monitors are active, diurnal monitors. They can travel great distances in search of food, security and for reproduction purposes. This is why it is imperative for keepers to provide adequate space, climbing and foraging opportunities in captivity.

Feeding a variety of insects paying close attention to the balance of proteins and fats, basing intake and frequency of feedings to the amount of activity and energy spent by the monitor, along with appropriate temperatures to aid in digestion will reduce the risk the of obesity occurring.

##HEPATIC LIPIDOSIS

Hepatic Lipidosis is a condition commonly diagnosed in Savannah Monitors. It is important to remember that Hepatic Lipidosis is a metabolic derangement and not a single clinical disease. The most common factors are as follow:

* High fat diets and obesity

* An increase in coelomic fat

* An increase in hapatic fat

* Reduced activity and absence of exercise

* Physiological disorder: lack of reproduction, lack of aestivation

* Chronic hyporexia and stress

Signs of Hepatic Lipidosis include obesity combined with lethargy, yellowish tinge on skin/gums/eyes, a compromised immune response and reproductive issues.

##GOUT

There are two forms of gout that commonly affect Savannah Monitors, visceral and articular. Primary visceral gout is the accumulation or build up of urate microcrystals in organs secondary to chronic hyperuricemia (an excess of uric acids in the blood) generally caused by excess protein in their diet. Secondary visceral gout is due to chronic hyperuricemia from such causes as dehydration and renal insufficiency. Signs of gout can include visible Tophi (crystals built up under the skin, forming white or yellow lumps) in the mouth, joints may be enlarged, stiff and painful. 

##CALCIUM DISORDERS: 

Nutritional Secondary Hyperparathyroidism, Metabolic Bone Disorder, Hypocalcemia (a condition in which the blood has too little calcium)

Nutritional Secondary Hyperparathyroidism (NSH)/Metabolic Bone Disorder (MBD). Since Savannah Monitors eat primarily invertebrates, they are prone to problems with calcium metabolism. In young monitors rapid growth combined with poor calcium-to-phosphorus ratios, lack of proper gutloading of feeders, lack of calcium supplementation and in most cases lack of proper UVB exposure nutritional secondary hyperparathyroidism occurs. Calcium  is a vital biochemical messenger used in many metabolic pathways and nerve transmission which means besides affected bones, any level of calcium deficiency can cause weakened muscle contraction (especially in the heart) and a decreased ability to form blood clots. If calcium levels drop too low, cardiac failure can occur. Calcium deficiencies can result from not only from low calcium but from too high phosphorus as well. Low calcium levels and high phosphorus levels both can cause a biological change which signals the body to obtain calcium from any available source, including bone. As calcium is leached from the bones they become soft and weak. As this progresses, the body in an attempt to stabilize structure replaces the bone loss with connective tissue resulting in visually apparent deformities.

Common signs of NSH/MBD are bowed or swollen legs, arched spine, bumps along the bones of legs/spine/tail and a bilateral softening of the jaw (commonly called rubber jaw)

 Ways to prevent these issues from occurring is to provide:

* Proper moderation of fat in diet
 
* Correct intake of calcium-to-phosphorus feeders

* Properly gut loading feeders

* Quality calcium supplements used in correct amounts

* Providing a combination of correct temperatures and UVB lighting

##GASTROINTESTINAL PARASITISM

Since the majority of Savannah Monitors are wild caught, intestinal parasites are common. The stress of collection, containment and shipping, along with improper living conditions can cause these parasitic infections to flourish. Nematodes, Cestodes and Protozoa are all commonly found in fecal samples of WC specimens. Tape worm eggs and a case of cryptosporidiosis have also been reported. This is why it is strongly recommended when acquiring a new Savannah Monitor fecal testing be done.

Common symptoms of parasitic infection include poor appetite, weight loss, vomiting/regurgitation, abdominal distension, diarrhea.

##INTESTINAL BLOCKAGE/IMPACTION/CONSTIPATION

There are numerous causes of irregular deification or fecal retention. The most common causes are as follows:

* Chronic dehydration. Commonly caused by insufficient humidity levels and inappropriate water source

* Parasitic infection

* Improper temperatures. Lack of sufficient basking surface temperature, temperature gradients, day/night temperature differences

* Ingestion of indigestible substrate like gravel, crushed walnut, bark, wood chips, mulch
*Lack of exercise

* Metabolic causes such as hypocalcemia

* Other causes include chronic systemic disease, intestinal neoplasia, kidney enlargement, abscesses, reproductive disease or presence of eggs

##NEOPLASIA

Neoplasia is the formation or presence of abnormal tissue, typically referring to tumors or masses. Savannah Monitors are susceptible to a variety of different neoplasms, especially liver and reproductive related. Often times the masses will present in a distended abdomen, which is actually fluid build up in the coelum. The coelum is the body cavity located between the intestinal canal and skin.

##VESTIBULAR DISEASE

The vestibular system is responsible for balance. The most common symptoms are a sudden onset of head tilt, abnormal eye movements and loss of balance. Loss of appetite, vomiting and tremors have also been reported. Possible causes are trauma, middle/inner ear disease, polyps, tumors, infection, GME (an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system), nerve damage, toxicity and hypothermia (over heating, producing stroke like symptoms). 

##ABSCESSES

Savannah Monitors are prone to abscesses. A unique abscess syndrome involving the feet is commonly seen in Savannah Monitors. The syndrome is likely related to environment and size of the monitor. Overly wet soil, improperly aerated soil, lack of proper soil maintenance due to lack of or insufficient CUC are more than likely contributing factors. A variety of gram-negative bacteria have been isolated from these abscesses. Most commonly affecting the hind feet but the front feet can be involved as well.

##RESPIRATORY DISEASE

Savannah Monitors are often diagnosed with respiratory issues. Causation is usually husbandry related, improper temperatures and consistently too low or too high humidity levels. Respiratory problems often present with increased mucus in the mouth and nasal passages. The monitor may keep their eyes closed, wheezing/popping/bubbling sounds may be heard. Gaping, open mouth breathing is commonly seen. 

##FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE ISSUES

  Follicular stasis (an ovarian issue). Common symptoms are anorexia, lethargy, constipation.

  Dystocia (egg binding). Common symptoms include visual appearance of abdominal swelling, lethargy, depression, non responsiveness.

Both have similar contributing factors including:

* Obstruction. Large fat deposits causing obstruction is often seen in Savannah Monitors

* Poor husbandry

* Improper nesting site

* Poor or inadequate diet

* Dehydration

* Poor physical condition
