# Is the Savannah Monitor the right pet for me?

## "No."
 Generally you will see a negative response [(Example.)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zqj4h8kx2M) regarding approval of owning a Savannah Monitor. There are many reasons why:


## Availbility

* If you buy your Savannah Monitor from a pet store, it is "Wild Caught", or WC for short. There are many reasons why this is bad. See more about how this affects savannah monitors and why you shouldn't support the pet trade [here.](www.reddit.com/r/savannahmonitor/wiki/stopsupplyanddemand) If you do not get a savannah monitor from a breeder, it is most likely wild caught. 

> Now you know. Please try to adopt or rescue. Captive Bred (CB) is recommended, a monitor bred by a breeder. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to find a breeder, as there are very few.


## Lifespan

* 99% of savannah monitors in captivity die before their natural lifecycle. Savannah monitors can live up to 20 years in the wild. In captivity, it is estimated that most live 3-5 years.

> This is another reason why it is recommended to buy a CB, as they are more likely to live longer in captivity. See why [here.(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJ0knVKPH_w)


## Cost

* Diet demand can be costly. Upfront costs of enclosure are also pricey.

## Space and size

* A full grown savannah monitor can get up to 3 feet. Enclosure size is essential to health. Not everyone can provide a minimum space of 8x4x4.

## Temperament

* Temperament. Savannah monitors are not puppy dogs. It has been said "a grumpy savannah monitor is a healthy savannah monitor" They are VERY intelligent. Work on their terms. Their feeding response is aggressive.
