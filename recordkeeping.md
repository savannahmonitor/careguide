# Preventative Health Measures 

## Quarantine and Record Keeping: 
 by JENIFER SOLIDA

This write up is to discuss the importance of quarantine when obtaining a new (to you) Savannah Monitor, especially when you have established collection of reptiles.

## WHAT IS QUARANTINE?

Quarantine is the act of isolating a newly acquired animal to note or treat any illness or injury, to monitor behavior, appetite, stool and activity.  It is also used to limit the risk of cross contamination, the spread of viral, bacterial and respiratory infections and the spread of intestinal or external parasites. 

## SETTING UP QUARANTINE

* Veterinary examination and diagnostic testing at the beginning of quarantine, follow up exam and testing prior to release from quarantine.

* Quarantine area should be situated away from established collection

* Quarantine enclosure should only contain one quarantined specimen

* If it is a multiple specimen quarantine, all new additions should enter and leave quaranting area at the same time

* Quarantine enclosures will need to meet all basic housing requirements (temperatures, thermal gradient, humidity, etc)

## QUARANTINE PERIOD

The minimum suggested time period for quarantine is 30 days but because the incubation period of many transmittable diseases that can affect reptiles is unknown, 60-90 days is preferable. 

## DETAILED RECORD KEEPING

Detailed record keeping during the quarantine period is recommended, this will enable you to track any changes and to have a detailed history for your veterinarian. You should note:

* weights and measurements: time and date

  (When measuring your savannah monitor, measure snout to vent, snout to tail, base of tail circumference, and weight)

* changes in husbandry

* daily behavior

* food intake, frequency and amounts

* daily water intake

* evacuation, both urates and stool

* daily activity levels

## SIGNS TO LOOK FOR DURING QUARANTINE PERIOD

* significant weight loss

* changes in feces: diarrhea, blood in stool

* vomiting, regurgitation

* respiratory discharge, “clicking” sounds associated with respiration

* anorexia

* lethargy

* dehydration

* external parasites

* swelling of eyelids

* neurological symptoms:  head tilt, circling, in-coordination, disorientation, etc    

* extended period of abdominal bloating

* lack of growth

* paralysis

* lesions

* difficulty shedding

## HYGIENE PRACTICES

Use an antibacterial soap before and after handling

Leave care of your quarantined animal last during daily management

Provide quarantine animals with their own feeding utensils (tongs), food and water containers. These should be sanitized last and separately.

Savannah Monitors stress easily and have very specified husbandry requirements.  When dealing with a single Savannah Monitor specimen, once there has been a well check and clear fecal result, they can be added to the enclosure type recommended by the group.  Follow up exams and fecals are still recommended for the 30, 60 and 90 days following the initial exam as well as observation and record keeping. The reason why this allowance can be made is because stress and poor husbandry can actually contribute to illness, disease and parasitic infection with your Savannah Monitor. 

If you already have a Savannah Monitor, are planning to introduce or cohabitate and/or keep other species of reptiles, traditional quarantine procedures will need to be followed.
