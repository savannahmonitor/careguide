Frequently Asked Questions: By JENIFER SOLIDA

### How do I sex my Sav?: 
Without veterinary assistance, you will have to wait until the Savannah Monitor reaches sexual maturity. During defecation, scenting or for purposes of reproduction you may be able to catch a glance at a male’s fully everted hemipenes. For females it is the production of a clutch (eggs). The only other reliable method is a minimally invasive procedure performed by a licensed exotic’s veterinarian called endoscopy. See group file “Sexing Savannah Monitors”

### What size of enclosure does my Sav need?: 
This group endorses, from hatchling-adult, a minimum 8x4x4 sealed wood enclosure. See group file “How to build an 8x4x4 Savannah Monitor Enclosure” and “Savannah Monitor Care”

### What do I feed my Sav?: 
This group promotes a diet based on their natural diet of arthropods (insects) and invertebrates (worms). See group file “Feeder Options, basic list”, “Insect feeder care”, “Feeder Suppliers”, “Common Disease and Disorders of Savannah Monitors” and “Dog Food-why not?”

### My hatchling Savannah Monitor is only accepting crickets, is that ok?: 
Wild gravid female Savannah Monitors often utilize cricket burrows to lay eggs. Once the hatchlings emerge from their eggs they will often share the burrow with these crickets, then once they grow large enough the monitors will begin to consume the crickets. Keep in mind the crickets in their natural habitat are much larger than the crickets sold in pet stores and are more closely related in size to large locusts. In captivity, it is common for newly acquired hatchlings to show a preference to crickets. This is why it is essential that all feeders be gutloaded and dusted every feeding, since the crickets that most owners have available do not offer the same nutritional value as the wild crickets already discussed. It is also important to continually offer other feeder options, so that eventually the monitor will recognize other options as feeders and readily accept them, this is to ensure that there are no nutritional deficits in diet. 

### How much and how often do I need to feed my Sav?: 
First you need to make sure that you are providing proper husbandry. Then you will need to research feeder options and their nutritional value. This will aid in developing a balanced diet for your Savannah Monitor, with appropriate amounts of calcium, calories, fats, proteins, phosphorus, vitamins and minerals. You need to base how much and how often you are offering feeders to their activity levels and the energy spent by your Savannah Monitor. Savannah Monitors up to 7-9 months can be offered basically an unlimited supply of appropriately balanced feeders, as this is the time of their most rapid growth. After that time, it is a good idea to reevaulate your monitors diet since this is when they begin to require less calories and fats, and food begins to fuel mostly activity levels. It would be advisable to use your Savannah as a que to how often and the amounts offered, you want your monitor to be slim/sleek bodied. Smaller feedings of lower fat options, 3-4 days between offering is often a formula used for adults. See group file “Common Disease and Disorders of Savannah Monitors”

### What temps do I need to offer?: 
A large basking area, with basking surface temps with ranges of 130-160F measured by a laser temp gun. Most owners of males have reported a preference of the ranges between 130-150F. While female Savannah Monitors seem to prefer the lower ranges. By providing a large basking area, your Savannah Monitor will be able to have access to various temperatures and choose its preference. For ambient temperatures, measured by a digital thermometer, cool side should range within 75-85F and hot side should range within 90-100F. See group file “Savannah Monitor Care”
What humidity does my Sav need?: The humidity of your enclosure needs to be monitored by a quality/accurate digital hygrometer. Just like temperatures offered, there needs to be a humidity gradient as well. They require VARYING humidity levels 65% and above (cool side reading).  Consistently too low humidity levels lead to respiratory issues, dehydration and organ failure. Consistently too high and you run the risk of respiratory issues and increased risk of bacterial related issues. See group file “Savannah Monitor Care” and “Common Disease and Disorders of Savannah Monitors”

### What kind of substrate do I use?: 
Earth dug from an area that has not been exposed to chemicals is the best option as it already includes beneficial microorganisms. Purchased options are a sand/additive free topsoil mix, this can be purchased from dirt yards, landscaping yards or box stores such as lowes/home depot/walmart. Common bagged option brands are Scotts Topsoil, Earthgro Topsoil, Timberline Topsoil and Quikrete/Sakrete Play sand. See group file “Bioactive Substrate”

### How much substrate do I need?: 
The recommended depth of substrate is 18-24”. The depth aids in maintaining humidity levels, thermoregulation and nesting needs of Savannah Monitors. 

### How do I tame my Sav?: 
This group endorses “monitor centered” taming methods, all interactions being on their terms. See group file “Savannah Monitor taming”

### Do I need to provide UVB and what kind? 
Yes, it is advisable to use UVB lighting. With the dietary recommendations and complications associated with D3 supplementation, it is not only beneficial but necessary for new owners to utilize. This also more closely replicates UVB exposure they would have access to in the wild. 10.0 UVB t5 or t8 lighting is recommended. See group file “Calcium deficiencies”, “Savannah Monitor Care” and “Common Disease and Disorders of Savannah Monitors”

### Shedding. Do they need any assistance or will it all flake off on it's own?: 
As long as you have good humidity levels and rough surfaces for them to rub on, they shouldn't need any assistance with shedding. The only time you would really need to is if the stuck shed was restricting blood flow

### Authors note:
Aquariums are for fish and amphibians, not Savannah Monitors.
Most caresheets and information that you find during a google search are incorrect and/or outdated.
Most youtube and social media displays of calm/cuddly Savannah Monitors are horrible examples of how to keep your Savannah Monitor properly and a high majority of the animals shown are cold, sick, lethargic and obese.

### So it's really safe to put worms and nightcrawlers loose in the soil and let juveniles forage? Isn't there a concern of impaction?
Yes, it is safe as long as the Sav is healthy and the substrate used is what is recommended by the group there is not an increased risk of impaction.

### wouldn't it be more accurate to suggest slowing of food intake based on SIZE and not age?
If fed based on energy use, as suggested, around 9 months would be when the requirements would change and the need for modification would occur

### Man i read this three times and am still a little confused on what to feed them and how often.
As you study and watch your monitor it will also become more accustomed. It's hard to understand reading. My suggestion is write on a calendar to start with. Write how often and how much. Watch your monitors growth and weight if its belly is touching it's too fat. Eventually you will see yourself set a pattern without even realizing its's a hatchling feed it more, when its growth slows cut down and start watching the monitors shape. Lean is keen. It took me a little bit to figure it out myself:)
