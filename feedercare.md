# FEEDER CARE: HOUSING/FEEDING/FARMING/BREEDING
 
by JENIFER SOLIDA

It is important to feed or “gut load” all prey items you offer your Savannah Monitor for at least 1-2 days prior to feedings. This will ensure your Savannah Monitor is getting proper nutrition from their food source instead of just an empty shell. Foods high in calcium and Vitamin A are especially important to feed your insects, and consequently your Savannah Monitor. Good sources of calcium include dark leafy greens (turnip/mustard/collard greens, kale, bok choy, spinach), broccoli and alfalfa pellets. Good sources of Vitamin A include carrots, squash and sweet potatoes. Dusting food you are offering your feeders with calcium and a multivitamin is recommended. The following are some guidelines on common feeders used...

## Roach care

Choose a container that is wider than it is tall, with smooth sides is easiest. Glass aquariums with mess lids or plastic tubs with modified lids (cut out a portion of the lid and hot glue mesh or screen over the space) are popular choices among keepers. Roaches do seem to do better in darker conditions, so dark colored tubs and covering exterior of aquariums is a common practice. Roaches need places to hide, this can easily be provided with cardboard egg crates. Place the crates vertically from front to back of container. You can keep roaches at room temperature but in order to provide optimal conditions for breeding offering 85-95F and 60-75% humidity is suggested. In order to provide these temperatures, UTH (under tank heater) or ceramic heat emitter can be used.  

Roaches can be offered a variety of foods, you can include commercial roach chow and should include fresh fruits and vegetables, especially those that contain carotenoids. Offer food and water source in shallow bowls that are easily accessible to the roaches. Be sure to remove any moldy foods regularly, as mold is highly toxic to your roaches and can kill off the entire colony. Avoid high protein foods, like dog food, since roaches convert excess protein into uric acid, something you do not want to be adding to your Savannah Monitors system. Offering water crystals is the easiest way to provide a water source.

Because of the way the egg crates are placed, most feces should drop to the bottom of the container. Substrate is not necessary for the container and can complicate cleanings. The container needs to needs to be cleaned every 1-2 weeks. It is helpful to have a secondary container, so that you can transfer egg crates and roaches to the 2nd container to clean the 1st.

## Cricket care

Similiar to the roach set up already described, crickets will need a container with adequate air flow, with mesh/screen lids. Crickets however need climbing space and less opportunity of being able to jump out of container when opened so a taller container would be recommended. Egg crates set up vertically from front to back. Substrate is not necessary but can be used. Common substrate is sani chips or aspen bedding. You can also provide toilet paper rolls or paper towel tubes for extra hiding places. Crickets do better in relatively low humidity, drier environments. Room temperature to 80F is the recommended temperature. 

Good gut loading options are fresh leafy greens and vegetable daily, as well as commercial options such as Fluker’s orange cube complete (this is a food and water source in one) or rep cal dry cricket food. Water source options that can be considered are water crystals or offering a damp sponge or cotton ball soaked in water daily. Standing water is a great hazard to crickets and not recommended. 

To encourage breeding a nesting container, a small plastic tub, place inside the container is adviseable. Moist sand, soil or coco fiber are good choice of substrate for the nesting container.  

## Superworms

Supers need to be kept at 70-85F, humidity levels are unimportant. Aquariums with screen lids or plastic tub with modified lid for proper ventilation. Substate is suggested for housing, popular options are oat bran, rolled oats, wheat germ or commercial superworm bedding. Make sure to keep substrate dry to prevent molding.  Replace substrate every couple of months. 

Offer fresh leafy greens and vegetables daily, placed directly on top of substrate. Do NOT offer a water source, they will receive hydration from the fresh foods provided. 

To breed and start your own colony of superworms, start with at least 100 worms. Supers take a long time to pupate, so do not get discouraged if you do not see beetles immediately. Collect the beetles and add them to a breeding container. Females can produce up to 500 eggs during its lifetime. It takes approximately 1 week for the eggs to hatch once laid.
 
## Earthworms/nightcrawlers

## BLACK SOLDIER FLY LARVAE

BSFL are one of the most nutritious feeder options available for hatching and juvenile Sav (larger/adults tend to ignore them, but are still a good option to try to add to their diet on occasion). 

There are a few options for housing, simple indoor setups can be made from deep/large rubbermaid totes or 5 gallon buckets with air holes drilled in the lid and towards the top of the container. If you live in a tropical area, large screen enclosures with enclosed bases are good option.

Substrate used can be eco earth, additive free topsoil or a mix of the two. Some breeders used rolled oats as a substrate that is also edible. It is better to have a deeper substrate (5-6 inches of eco-earth/soil substrate, or 8 inches of oats) to give the larvae plenty of space and the adult flies space to lay their eggs.

Keep temperatures between 77-95F. Humidity should be between 60-90%. Make sure that substrate does not become overly wet or too dry.

Diet: they are natural and efficient composters. Vegetables, leafy greens, fruits, peels, coffee grounds. Avoid meats and fats.

The life cycle of BSF is 45 days total. 4 days in egg stage, 18 days in larva stage, 14 days pre-pupa. 9 days adult stage. Female BSF can lay around 500 eggs.

## SILKWORMS

Silkworms are one of the best and highest quality feeders that you can offer your Sav. They are also expensive to purchase and often are out of stock. 

Hatching eggs: small tupperware containers, similiar to deli cups can hold about 200 eggs. They do not require nesting substrate. Many people have successfully hatched silkworm by keeping containers in a room or area that has a consistent temperatures of 80-85F, however there have been better results with the use of an incubator. You will want to keep the eggs relatively dry or they will mold easily. Eggs take approximately 1 week to hatch using an incubator, other methods have produced varying hatch times. While the eggs are hatching you can use a syringe and apply a thin line of silkworm chow (you can purchase this from vendors and online from sites like Mulberry farms or Coastal Silkworm) next to where the eggs are hatching. The emerging worms will crawl from the shells to the line to feed.

Larvae stage: The 1st 10 days of this stage are critical. Every 1 to 2 days reapply the line of food for the new worms to feed from, one the old food is gone or dried up. Reapply new line food in same line, the worms will continue to return to that area. After 10 days the worms can be moved to a 56qt plastic tub. They can withstand temperature fluctuations better at this point but try to keep their temps around 80F. The tub lid should be modified by removing center plastic and replacing with screen. Also add holes around the top portion of container. You want the environment to be well ventilated and low humidity. Place a cut piece of gutter guard in the bottom of container on one end and on the other end, fill the space with toilet paper tubes (cut the tubes mid way so you end up with 2 identical tubes from one) place sitting so the openings are towards top and bottom of container. These will be for the worms to crawl up into when they begin to cocoon. During this time you can offer silkworm chow, mulberry leaves and carrot for gut loading. They do not require a water source, receiving all their hydration from food. The larvae stage last about 27 days

COCOON: At this stage you will begin to see the larvae begin spinning their cocoon. During this phase they should not be disturbed, the will not eat during this time. It takes about 2-3 weeks for the pupa to metamorphose into an adult moth.

MOTH: Once the moths emerge from the cocoons their sole purpose is to mate. Males tend to be larger than females and more active. Within 24 hrs of mating the male dies. Meanwhile, the female lays an abundance of eggs and then dies as well. On this happens, you will need to remove the eggs and start to whole process again.
