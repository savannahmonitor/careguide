It is endorsed to use a monitor centered approach to taming. NO force handling unless medically necessary. Allow interactions to be positive and on the monitors terms.

###Stage 1

Stage 1 - Environmental management reduce environmental stress, increase confidence, increase ethological appropriate enrichment

This includes opportunities to explore, forage and dig...

###Stage 2

Stage 2 - Changing the underlying emotion: fear of caregiver.

Activity feeding in the caregivers presence at a distance utilizing systematic desensitization and counter conditioning. This builds an appetitive association between environment, enrichment and caregiver. Increasing foraging activities allows for natural behavior, increases confidence and caregiver bond.

When the save continues to forage with caregiver net to the enclosure it is a sign of systematic desensitization and counter conditioning are taking an affect.

###Stage 3

Stage 3 - Reinforcing calm behaviors

One way is giving really tasty treats in the caregivers presence. 
Place your hand in the enclosure and offer a treat, leading the savannah monitor to or over your hand. The savannah monitor should be able to choose to interact with the caregivers hand. When the savannah monitor is close enough or has walked on your hand, you reward its behavior. 

This makes the caregiver no longer scary! Soon, interacting with the caregiver is fun!

Later handling is tolerated.

Note: Do not grab your savannah from above. this reenacts birds of prey and will stress them out.
