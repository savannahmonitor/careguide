# Female Care 

by JENIFER SOLIDA

Female Savannah Monitors in captivity have a higher mortality rate than their male counterparts. In a study of captive monitors in zoo settings reproductive complications contributed to 11.5% of deaths in females. We see this too often with privately owned Savannah Monitor females as well. While the husbandry of both male and female Savannah Monitors is largely similar, there are modifications that can aid in reducing the occurrence of complications for females.

Because Savannah Monitors are difficult to sex by a majority of owners, it is a good idea to implement modifications early on. This will ensure that if your Savannah Monitor is female, all aids are in place at time of sexual maturity. 
Owners are often confused when it comes to sexual maturity of Savannah Monitors, measuring by age. Sexual maturity is actually more so correlates to size. Female Savannah Monitors can reach sexual maturity in the wild around 500g and 27cm (10.63 inches) according to Daniel Bennett’s observations. If properly supported, it is conceivable that captive females would be able to as well. Another common misconception is that females need a male present to ovulate or produce a clutch of eggs, this is not the case. Females can produce infertile clutches without a mate present.
Common reproductive complications are preovulatory follicular stasis (an ovarian issue) or postovulatory egg stasis or dystocia (egg binding). 

Hormones (estrogen) stimulate the liver to convert the adipose tissue (fat) and dietary lipids into vitellogenesis. Vitellogenesis is also known as yolk deposition, the process of yolk formation via nutrients being deposited in the oocyte or female germ cell. The vitellogenin is then absorbed by the follicles, aiding in their development. At this time large amounts of calcium are also collected in the follicles. Following the maturation of the follicles, a surge of luteinizing hormone (LH) causes ovulation. The ova are released from the follicles and taken up into the oviducts. In the oviducts is where the shell is formed and becomes an egg.

An interruption in follicular development can lead to preovulatory stasis. The cause is often husbandry related. If the monitor is lacks proper amounts of UVB exposure and has insufficient calcium in diet and supplementation, it may not be able to complete ova development and subsequently will not ovulate.

Postovulatory egg stasis occurs when the Savannah Monitor ovulates and develops eggs but is  unable to pass them from the oviduct. This problem may arise because of the eggs themselves (malpositioning, malformation or rupture) or a problem with the monitor such as pelvic malformation, masses not related to the reproductive tract or bladder stones. Other common causes are poor physical condition of the female (lack of muscle tone or obesity), dehydration, low temperatures, low humidity and lack of suitable nesting areas.

The following are examples of how to reduce the risk of husbandry related factors:

* Provide a balanced, properly gut loaded insect based diet

* Provide quality calcium only supplements, dusting feeders at every feeding

* Provide proper UVB levels using 10.0 t5 or t8 UVB lighting

* Provide 18-24” suitable substrate

* Provide sufficient space and opportunity for exercise and muscle development

* Provide correct basking/ambient temperatures and temperature gradients

* Provide correct humidity levels

* Provide fresh, clean drinking water daily

* Make sure your female is healthy and parasite free with regular veterinary check ups

* Provide suitable nesting areas

Without suitable nesting sites a female Savannah Monitor may be reluctant to lay, and retain the eggs causing dystocia (the condition of egg binding described above). In the wild females can dig a nest 15-30cm (5.9-11.8 inches). Providing sufficient substrate depth of 18-24” is important, as many 1st clutches of captive females are laid on top of the substrate or laid in burrows. If there is any issue with substrate being too cold, the female reluctant to burrow, or issues in housing having a nesting box where the conditions are easier to control is a way to avoid the enclosure environment from deterring laying. The nesting box can enable the owner to provide “perfect” conditions conducive to laying. Commonly nesting boxes are made from rubbermaid totes (opaque) or sealed wooden material in a basic box shape. Cut out an opening for an entry way or you can use piping inserted into an opening to replicate a tunnel leading to the nesting box, top opening for easy access to eggs once laid.  Whatever the material used the important part is that they provide sufficient space, a feeling of security for the monitor, warmth and moisture/humidity without risk of bacterial or mold growth that would encourage maternal use. The nesting box should be placed on the cool side of the enclosure to allow for more control of temperatures within the structure and to avoid overheating. Suggested size is 120x75x45-60 (approximately 4ftx30inx18-24in). Common nesting substrates used are peat moss, coco fiber/eco earth, topsoil and sand. Substrate should be damp but not overly wet. Substrate should fill nesting structure, requiring female to dig upon entry. To provide heat interior substrate adequately, the use of a heat mat or UTH is suggested. Cover heating option with ceramic tile to eliminate risk of contact with monitor. A cord cover/protector should be used to reduce contact with moisture and avoid any damage to cord by monitor. image: https://imgur.com/U0ujwSy



Stefan Windsor was kind enough to share a thread related to the subject of nesting sites, it includes suggestions from a keeper, David Kirshner, that has had great success in breeding Lace Monitors in captivity, members may find this useful as a guide for setup:

I just want to thank Stefan, Lori, David and my favorite veterinarian Dr. Diaz for their contributions to this document, it is very much appreciated:)
