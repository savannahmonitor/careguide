#Enrichment: Psychological Health of Captive Savannah Monitors

 by JENIFER SOLIDA

Unfortunately new and inexperienced owners may make choices for enclosures that are not beneficial for their Savannah Monitor based on outdated and incorrect advice given from pet store employees, reptile show vendors, caresheets and internet sites and from “breeders”.  Choices are also made based on aesthetics and/or convenience.  None of the previously mentioned should define how your Savannah Monitor is kept.  Even with experienced keepers we often see sedentary and overweight Savannah Monitors.  If captive Savannah Monitors do not recieved better supportive care, this trend will continue.

Enrichment by definition is the action of improving or enhancing the quality or value of something.  How it relates to captive reptile keeping is the actions taken to improve the quality of life for captive reptiles.  Captive enrichment is a combinations of mental and physical stimulation.  My favorite explanation of this concept was by Animal World and Snake farm, “The best way to explain enrichment is through the acronym E.N.R.I.C.H: Encourage Natural Response In Captive Habitats”.

Providing proper nutrition, caging, lighting, temperature, substrate and humidity are necessary otherwise disease can result.  Providing larger, more naturalistic enclosures is recommended for reptiles to provide enrichment and more exhibition of natural behaviors.  Through enrichment and training, one can improve the captive welfare of their animal along with their relationship with that animal (Rupley).  When captives have choice over aspects of their environment, and are able to exercise control over interations with their surroundings their welfare can be improved. 
Providing enrichment needs to be safe, support the needs of the specific species and all of the captives senses should be considered.

##FEEDING ENRICHMENT

Live insect scatter: tossing live insects into the enclosure to provide natural foraging opportunities
Passive insect feeders:  this can be commercially bought Kong toys or feeder puzzles, or man made capped off PVC piping or cleaned out gourds or coconuts with appropriate sized holes drilled for insects used.

##PHYSICAL ENRICHMENT

Temperature gradient:  providing a large temperature gradient allows the Sav to choose a preferred temperature
Temperature variations:  providing day time temperatures and a drop of temperature at night to replicated natural temperature highs and lows

Substrate: replicating natural soils and providing sufficient substrate for burrowing, tilling soil periodically will add enrichment and is an important part of soil maintenance

Misting:  helps replicated increases in humidity levels

UVB lighting: to simulate UVB exposure it would receive in it’s natural habitat

Enclosure furnishing: branches for climbing opportunities, modifications to walls to allow for climbing opporunities, basking platforms to replicate natural basking behaviors

Retreats:  hides, burrows, “clutter” to help your Sav feel less exposed and more secure

##OLFACTORY

Scent trails:  this works well with snail slime and hornworms, but can work with pretty much any feeder option.  Out of sight from your Sav, drag feeder along the ground to creat a scent trail, end trail in an area where the feeder will be obscured and not be easily seen by your monitor

Shed: if you have access to other reptiles that you know are healthy, you can add their shed to your monitors enclosure for a new scent

Leaf litter: adding and freshening leaf litter will add new scents to your monitors enclosure
Buried feeders:  dig out a shallow hole in the enclosure substrate, add slow moving feeders like earthworms and then cover over with a thin application of soil or leaves

##OVERALL ENRICHMENT

Providing your Sav with a safe, secure, enclosed area outdoors (not restrained by holding or leashes) for exposure to natural elements while under close supervision
