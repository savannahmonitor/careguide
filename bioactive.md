#Bioactive Substrate
By JENIFER SOLIDA

##1. What is Bioactive substrate?

Bioactive substrate contains the elements necessary for biological processes to occur within the enclosure, a mini eco system.  The natural good bacteria, microbes, invertebrates that live in the soil act as a sanitation crew. Often referred to as Clean Up Crew or CUC for short.

Common purchased substrate mix:

* Additive free topsoil: Scott’s Topsoil, EarthGro topsoil, Timberline topsoil, Aquasoil are a few that are available
* Washed playsand

Some owners have had good results adding the following to the mix for improved moisture retention, form and plant growth: peat moss, clays, Arcadia Earthmix

Another option is to locate an area that has not been exposed to chemicals, is away from road sides, away from water sources and dig. These are referred to as “clean” areas. Natural soil has the advantage of already containing micro-organisms. 

##2. Leaf litter:
