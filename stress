#Stress and captive Savannah Monitors

by JENIFER SOLIDA

Savannah Monitors are extremely susceptible to stress. They are naturally a shy species and captivity itself provides a consistent source of stress.  Stress may be a contributing factor to the high early mortality rate seen with captive specimens.  This write up is to provide information on how to recognize stress responses of your monitor, the importance of stress reduction and how to apply it in a captive setting. 

Stress can affect immune function, the endocrine system, parasitic levels, hormones and reproduction, metabolic response.  Consistent spikes and chronic exposure to stressors can have a negative affect on the overall health of your monitor. 

##COMMON CAUSES OF STRESS IN CAPTIVITY

* Artificial lighting

* Exposure to loud or obtrusive noises

* Odors

* Uncomfortable temperature 

* Uncomfortable substrate

* Low humidity levels

* Restricted movement, restraining

* Reduced retreat space

* Forced proximity to humans

* Maintenance in abnormal social groups

* Handling

* Overcrowding

* Changes in environment

##SIGNS OF STRESS

 > PRIMARY RESPONSE TO STRESS: search and escape, fight or flight

 >> SECONDARY RESPONSE TO STRESS: biological shut down, self preservation method to reduce involuntary responses to stress   

###CLINICAL ASSESSMENT

* Blood chemistry

* Fecal sampling

###VISUAL ASSESSMENT

* Interaction with transparent boundaries (commonly referred to as “glass surfing”)

* Hyperactivity: abnormal high level physical activity

* Hypoactivity: inhibition of behavioral or locomotor activity

* Anorexia: a lack or loss of appetite for food

* Hyperalertness: abnormal level of alertness, “nervousness”

* Rapid body movement: “startled” reaction

* Inflation of body

* Rapid swallowing

* Hissing

* Tailwhipping

* Biting not feeding related

* Clutching: tightly grasps human or object

* Freezing

* Hesitant mobility

* Open mouth breathing

* Eye closing

* Cloacal evacuation when held

* Regurgitation

* Pigment changes

* Difficulty shedding

* Lethargy

* Infrequent deification

* Sedentary behaviors

##VISUAL CUES OF COMFORT

* Normal, relaxed movement

* Calmly smelling or tasting objects or air

* Relaxed posture

* Relaxed environmental exploration

##WAYS TO MINIMIZE STRESS IN A CAPTIVE ENVIRONMENT

* Establish beneficial conditions in enclosure

* Recreate a naturalistic environment

* Provide sufficient opportunities for hiding (ie. “clutter”, hides, places that provide cover)

* Providing sufficient basking temperatures and ambient temperatures for your Savannah Monitor to be able to maintain 
preferred core temperature range (internal body temperature) of 85F-91.4F.

* Providing an ambient temperature gradient of 75F-100F

* Providing varying higher humidity levels (65% plus)

* Lighting to mimic natural light cycles

* Provide enrichment opportunities

* Avoid overhandling or force handling (unless medically necessary/emergency situation) 

* Avoid continual disturbances

* Learn your Savannah Monitors behaviors so that stress responses can more easily be identified
