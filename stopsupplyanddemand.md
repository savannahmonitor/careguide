### Captive savannah monitors have a mortailty rate of 90%  

Irresponsible mass export/import practices and the high early mortality rate, even with multiple responses on threads explaining all of this information, there are still members of the reptile community continuing to be a part of the problem.  I hope that this write up will be a bit more effective, if you care at all about Savannah Monitors and have even a small amount of respect for the species, it should serve not only as a deterrent but a reason to help stop the importation of this species.  Just a heads up this write up is going to be including my opinion, not just facts, because I am tired of seeing Savannah Monitors suffering.

There is a common question posted, “Why do Savannah Monitors fail in captivity?”.  There is a very easy answer to this.  OWNERS.  The CITES database recorded from 1792 (the year Bosc discovered the species) to 2005, around 650,000 specimens exported/traded.  CITES has tools in place to regulate export called an export quota.  The purpose of CITES export quotas is to provide a cap, a maximum number of specimens of a species that will not be detrimental to the survival of the species that can be collected in a years time.  Unfortunately there is nothing in place to provide the same protection after they are exported.  

When you research expected life span of captive Savannah Monitors, the resulting numbers vary but usually range between 8-15+ years.  The reality is, based on observations of social media, information collected from veterinarians, herpetological societies and Savannah Monitor owners, the average expected life span of a captive Savannah Monitor is 4 years of age.  That is after the initial 80-90% high early mortality rate prior to the age of 2.  This is for a species that should biologically be able to live to possibly 20 years of age.  

Since the introduction of Savannah Monitors into the pet trade there has been quite a bit of evolution in care advice but the results are still the same, all Savannah Monitors dying sooner than they should.  Yes, we can attribute the high mortality rate to impulse buys, inexperienced owners, the cheap price tag equaling cheap care and a throw away mentality, fish tanks, diet, improper environment.  The thing is though, even with owners that provide “proper care”, Savannah Monitors are still dying prematurely.  Some people want to take that as a challenge, that they will be the one that discovers the answer to being able to properly support this species but seriously?  How entitled are we that we can justify all the suffering these animals go through in that quest?  How entitled are we that we can justify all the suffering these animals go through just to satisfy our needs, wants, desires and curiosity?
There are some in the reptile community that think that breeding is a measured success when it comes to this species, and that it could be the answer to diminishing or stopping the mass importation.  There are some flaws to this thinking.  Even with an increase in the availability of CBB Savannah Monitors it would be extremely difficult (impossible) for breeders  to compete with the WC specimens that come at a much lower cost and a higher availability.  There is very little evidence to suggest that captive breeding Savannah Monitors would reduce the amounts being removed from the wild.  Though CBB specimens do have some advantages over WC, they would still face the same issues and meet the same fate, premature death because we still do not know how to properly support them in captivity.

### COMMON ACTIONS BY PEOPLE THAT SUPPORT THE MASS IMPORTATION:

“I rescued this Sav from the petstore”:  what this actually did was #1 fund mass importation, #2 supply demand, #3 showed the petstore that Savannah Monitors can produce a profit and the one you “saved” will now be replaced by at least one other Savannah Monitor or more (same result from the following actions)

Ordering Savannah Monitors from online sites

Buying Savannah Monitors or “rescuing” Savannah Monitors from show vendors

Buying hatchlings from social media sites (that is not a rehome situation):  captive born and captive hatched, still collected from the wild (still part of the problem).  If a person claims they are CBB but cannot provide proof of parents, copulation, nesting site, incubation and hatching, its not a CBB and you are still contributing to the problem.

Suggesting to other people that Savannah Monitors are a “good first monitor”, a “good choice as a pet”, inferring in any way that another person should go out and buy a Savannah Monitor is contributing to the problem.
The solution to stopping the unnessary suffering of Savannah Monitors in captivity is to stop supporting the demand for them in the pet trade.  I know that that is a huge task but it is simple economics, once the demand lowers so will the supply.  End the demand, End the supply. 

### WAYS TO STOP DEMAND

Do not purchase Savannah Monitors from pet stores, vendors or importers

If you have your heart set on owning a Savannah Monitor, make sure you are prepared to offer the most beneficial care known from day one and offer a good home to a Savannah Monitor in need of rescue or rehome from a private person
If seller claims a Savannah Monitor to be a CBB, require verification of this prior to consider purchasing
Work towards changing the acceptance of Savannah Monitors being in the pet trade by others in the reptile community
Stop jumping on posts talking about how great your Savannah Monitor is when people ask if they should buy one
Stop endorsing Savannah Monitors as a good choice for unprepared potential owners
Start educating people on the amount of time these monitors have been suffering in the pet trade and we still do not know how to properly support them
