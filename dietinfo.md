 by JENIFER SOLIDA

## Health issues due to poor diet

Obesity and connected health issues are very common with captive Savannah Monitors. This is in part due to owner ignorance of natural feeding intervals, natural diet, signs of obesity, nutritional values of feeders offered, giving into your monitor’s “gluttony”.

Common issues seen in captive Savannah Monitors due to overfeeding and improper diet:

* gout: excess protein in diet; excess uric acid levels in blood stream, affects joints, extremely painful

* fatty liver disease/syndrome: excess fats in diet; liver cells are filled with fat deposits impeding liver function
soft tissue minerilization: excess calcium and Vitamin D

* Nutritional Secondary Hyperparathyroidism: caused by lack of gutloading insect/invert feeders, offering feeders low in calcium but high in phosphorus

* cycling issues in females: excess fat storage retarding egg laying; lack of appropriate fat storage retarding ability to suppor egg production

Diet has long been debated in the Savannah Monitor community, you will often see on the old forums and even on FB the “it’s diet, it’s environment” back and forth.  Personally I find those debates shortsighted. It isn’t an either/or problem. It is BOTH. Yep, I said it. BOTH. OWNERS NEED TO PROVIDE A PROPER DIET PLAN AND A BENEFICIAL ENVIRONMENT. I would not think that realization to be rocket science but here we are 40 plus years into Savannah Monitors dying in captivity and people are still having the either/or debate. 

## Environment

First you need to start off with a beneficial environment.  This means provide basking surface temperatures that aid metabolic rates and digestion.  This means providing sufficient space for your Savannah monitor to exercise.  This means keeping your Savannah monitor active, offering enrichment and climbing opportunities.  This means providing a large thermal gradient for your Savannah monitor to be able to thermo-regulate efficiently.  This means provide fresh water daily and higher varying humidity levels to prevent dehydration.  This means limiting stress. This means provide UVB to avoid nutrional deficiencies.  This mean providing sufficient substrate depth for burrowing and nesting options. Once you have done that then you are set to start on a diet plan for your Savannah Monitor. 

## Feed based on energy use

You will often see the comment “feed based on energy use”.  This means finding the balance between input of energy from food and the output of energy in the form of bodily functions.  The food offered to your Savannah Monitor breaks down to 3 main sources of energy; protein, fat, carbohydrates. Fat contains twice as many calories as proteins. Hatchling and juvenile Savannah Monitors will require the most energy input because it will be supporting growth, development and locomotion (movement).  Around 9 months of age the requirement for that energy will begin to lessen and the input of energy will begin to fuel mainly locomotion.  This is when your sub-adult/adult Savannah Monitor’s food intake will need to be re-evaluated and based solely on activity levels.  The more active the Savannah monitor, the more energy input required, the less active the less energy input required.  This balance, or lack of, has a lot to do with whether your Savannah monitor will gain weight, lose weight, or maintain weight. 

Something that needs to be understood by owners is how reptiles metabolize differently than mammals or avians.  Reptiles are an ectothermic species, this means unlike mammals or avians, they do not waste energy maintaining their body temperature.  The caloric requirements for a mammal of a similiar size to your Savannah monitor for just a day could fuel your Sav for a month.

In the wild Savannah Monitors can travel great distances, are exposed to natural elements (and sometimes harsh environments), prepare for breeding opportunities and approximately 6 months of aestivation (please see [Aestivation]([www.reddit.com/r/savannamonitor/wiki/aestivationestivation](https://github.com/savannahmonitor/careguide/blob/main/aestivation.md))).  While we do suggest following a more natural diet as far as types of feeders, because captives do not normally experience any of what I mentioned in the previous statement they have a significantly lower calorie requirement. 

Captive Savannah Monitors will need to be provided a calcium supplement to avoid calcium deficiencies, dust all feeders offered.

You need to be able to identify visual ideas of what a Savannah Monitor of a healthy weight should be.  Far too often on social media we see photos of overweight to morbidly obese captive Savannah Monitors and that is what has been accepted as the “norm”.  By researching wild Savannah Monitor images you can get a better idea of what a healthy Savannah Monitor would look like.  They are slender in the wild, not the tub of lard that you just saw being swaddled in a towel and cuddled on instagram/FB/youtube. You want your Savannah Monitor to be lean, with a sleek profile.  Closely tracking and being aware of what you are feeding your Savannah Monitor, as well as tracking its growth (weights and measurements) will help you to make better decisions about it’s care. 

### Things to consider for your diet plan:

* age of Savannah Monitor

* caloric requirement of your Savannah Monitor

* nutritional/caloric content of feeders offered; calcium:phosphorus ratio (preferred range 1.5:1/2:1) and protein:fat ratio (preferred range 1:.5)

* importance of gutloading

* amounts and frequency     

* supplements

## Diet Advice

Hatchling/Juvenile Savannah Monitors need to be fed daily.  As an owner you have the opportunity to provide an environment reflective of their natural environment. You can add earthworms and nightcrawlers, roaches, superworms to their enclosure that will not only provide a supply of food for your young Savannah monitor but they also have the added benefit of enclosure maintenance.  This is perfect for newly acquired Savannah monitors that are still getting comfortable with their new surroundings and may not yet be used to feeders offered on tongs. It also helps support the natural behavior of foraging, which means that your Savannah Monitor will be expending energy to hunt down prey (built in exercise opportunity!).  Quite a few young Savannah monitors will show preference to crickets which is completely normal but you will need to continue attempts to offer a larger variety of feeders to cover a broader range of nutritional needs.  

Sub adult/Adult Savannah Monitors will need fasting days in between food offerings.  As discussed above, around 9 months energy provided by food will begin to mainly fuel locomotion.  The Savannah Monitor’s activity levels will determine the content, amounts and frequency of feedings needed.  The portion size and content of meals offered will determine the amount of fasting days between feedings.

What I have found helpful is sitting down and looking at nutritional content of feeders I offer.   Balancing fats and proteins, calcium and phosphorous.  Providing the largest variety of feeders and alternating what I offer helps with providing a balance of vitamins and minerals as well.

You will see that the numbers vary from site to site (often based on what the site is selling and what stage the insect is in) but these are the average nutritional values for most commonly offered feeders.  Something that an owner also needs to take into consideration is what is used to gutload feeders prior to feeding off, as this does affect the values received by the monitor.
