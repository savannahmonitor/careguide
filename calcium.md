# Calcium

## RECOMMENDATIONS: 

* change UVB bulb often

* Calcium powder formulated with calcium carbonate with no impurities, phosphorus, or lead

* Use calcium+vitamin d if no UVB bulb

## Warning
Vitamin D is toxic when given in high doses. This can happen with overzealous supplementation. (UVB and vitamin D together) Signs of toxicity are soft tissue calcification of many body organs which can be visible on radiographs. Treatment is with aggressive fluid therapy.

# Calcium deficiencies

By JENIFER SOLIDA

In the reptile community calcium deficiencies are usually grouped under the blanket explanation of MBD (metabolic bone disease). The issue is a common husbandry related problem that could be easily avoided. The following are excerpts from a great article that I believe could benefit members greatly, CALCIUM DEFICIENCIES: THE “SECRET” TO AVOID THEM by Ivan Alfonso, DVM.

“Reptiles need calcium to grow, produce eggs, and to move around on a daily basis. Calcium is an essential mineral to reptile health but providing our reptiles with a tub of calcium every day doesn’t ensure they will get proper calcium in their system. You see, calcium absorption is a process and there are many important steps needed for this process to go smoothly. Yes, availability of calcium is important but calcium can’t be absorbed in the reptile’s body without vitamin D3. Vitamin D3 is produced naturally in the reptile’s body by exposure to Ultraviolet Light B (UVB). UVB is part of the natural, unfiltered sunlight spectrum. So here is the process in a nutshell: A reptile basks in the sun to warm up and to absorb UVB rays. These UVB rays trigger the kidneys to produce Vitamin D3, which will go into the bloodstream and allow the cells to absorb calcium. That means a strong, happy reptile that can move around, can grow and can reproduce normally. Simple huh? Then why do we still have issues in this hobby with calcium deficiencies? I don’t know, but I have a few suspicions that I will list below: 

**Improper exposure to artificial UVB-** Many keepers can’t take their reptiles outdoors for many reasons and they depend entirely on artificial bulbs for their UVB. Nothing wrong with that as long as the proper bulbs are used and we can make sure proper levels of UVB are being produced. There are many bulbs on the market that only produce UVA but not UVB and keepers buy them thinking that it is a “UV” bulb. Well, it is a UV bulb but not a UVB bulb which makes a huge difference. Different bulbs will produce different levels of UVB for different amounts of time and sometimes keepers buy the right type of bulb but it doesn’t get changed frequently enough thus leading to little to no UVB exposure over time. This is why it is recommended to change bulbs every 6-12 months depending on the bulb or buy a UVB meter which will tell you how much UV is being produced by your bulbs. If you measure a drop in the UVB production from your bulbs, then it is time to change them.

**Excessive reliance on Vitamin D3 supplements-** There is still some train of thought that if you use vitamin D3 daily when supplementing, then you have no need for UVB. The thinking being that by providing D3 you are bypassing the step in the process where UVB triggers the production of D3 in the reptile’s body. It would seem this is a logical step but it fails to show that excessive use of D3 causes severe liver issues and premature death. Reptiles can produce as much D3 naturally as they need with the exposure to UVB but when you provide D3 externally you have no way of determining how much or how little you are actually giving your reptiles. You could be underdosing them thus depriving them of calcium absorption or you could just as well overdose them and cause a new set of health issues. Artificial supplementation has it’s place in reptile husbandry, but it should not be used to replace the natural way.


**Availability of calcium-** Not all calciums are made the same and some seem better suited for certain reptiles than others. Calcium Carbonate is the standard form of calcium used in the hobby but there are other forms of calciumout there that are more bioavailable for reptiles once digested. What’s the catch? Some of the products stick better to insects than others, some products are thinner than others, some taste better than others, and some products clump quicker than others. It is a matter of trial and error when you choose your calcium, but make sure you choose one that fits your reptile and it’s needs. You will likely need a calcium product that sticks well to insects if you are feeding insectivores, like chameleons, that need to hunt their food. If you are feeding carnivores, their food is usually on the moist side, so you need a calcium that sticks to that food without creating too much of a thick paste that could discourage the reptiles from eating it. Not understanding these factors can lead to the use of a good product that doesn’t fit your reptile’s lifestyle thus leading to poor ingestion of the calcium and low availability of this mineral in the body.

**Improper diets-** We are what we eat, and so are our reptiles. If we don’t provide them with a well balance diet and depend solely on calcium supplements we might never be able to do right by them. The closest we can get to providing our reptiles to a natural diet (what they would eat normally in the wild), the more likely they are to get as much nutrients as they would in the wild. This would limit the need for extra supplementation and would allow us to develop a system where we alter their diets on a minimal basis rather than every day or so. We can never duplicate nature but we should aim to do it anyway”. (Alfonso, 2011)
