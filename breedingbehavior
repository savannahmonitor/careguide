#(UK)Captive Breeding/Nesting Of Varanus Exanthematicus

By Dean Cheetham

###Introduction:

I am not very good at literature but i wanted to put together this slightly more in depth
document when it comes to Exanthematicus and breeding behaviours, in the hope it may benefit
the species and some keepers. I apologize if it is not put together very well, but here goes!

 A brief look into the breeding and nesting behaviors of V.Exanthematicus in captivity. These are
some of the things i will run through with you all. I want to make it clear, these are NOT guidelines
to follow, but what has worked for me.

* My Enclosure Size and substrate

* Temperatures and humidity

* Nestbox design, size and substrate

* Breeding behaviours - Copulation, gestation, nesting and laying

###My enclosure size and substrate:

The size Enclosure i provide for my pair is 5x4x4(feet)

My choosen substrate with in the enclosure is a mix of sterilized topsoil and playpit sand and
coconut coir at a mixed ratio of 40% sterilized topsoil 30% coconut coir and 30% playpit sand. 
(these are rough figures).

I provide a substrate depth of 18" through out the entire enclosure.

###Temperatures and humidity:

The temperatures and humidity i provide with in my enclosure are as follows.

* Basking temperature - 140-150f

* Ambient air temperature - 80-85f

* Cool end temperature - 70-75f

* Humidity - 60% (allowing it to drop as low as 45-50% from time to time)

* Substrate humidity - 99%

###Nestbox size, temperature & substrate:

With in the enclosure i provide a nestbox.

It is made from CLS treated timber, lined with pond liner and a plywood lid with a 4" hole in one
corner with dimensions of 18x20x20" (inches) buried in the enclosure substrate.

I designed it to be heated from above by the basking lamps to create a heated nesting area with
temperatures ranging from 80-85f (the highest point i.e the top of the nestbox substrate being
hottest and the lowest being the coolest)

The Substrate i provide with in the nestbox is a compacted mix of Sterilized topsoil, playpit sand
and sphagnum moss at a ratio of 70% playpit sand and 30% Topsoil with a top layer consisting of
3 litres of Sphagnum moss which is misted every few days prior to nesting.

###Copulation behaviour:

The male will start scratching the females neck and hind limbs followed by some possible
nibbling of the neck area and smelling around the females vent area. He will then proceed to
mount the female. using his hind limbs he will try to pin the female down by holding onto her
rear legs with one of his rear limbs to prevent her from moving whilst using his other limb to
raise her tail. she will resist all the time she is not ready but eventually she will give in and allow
the male to lock with her (vent to vent). This particular copluation lasted 5 hours but it could
spread over a few days.

###Gestation:

Once copulation has been successful, gestation period begins. (eggs developing inside the
womb). This normally lasts between 18-24 days. The female will become a bit more lethargic
spending most of the time basking and sleeping in odd positions.

###Nesting:

Nesting behaviours will begin with in the 18-24 gestation period, this will consist of the female
digging "test" burrows. once the female is happy with the location she will dig her final burrow.
Both my females laid in burrows roughly 6-8" deep but they have been known to submerge their
entire bodies. The female will likely go back and fourth to this burrow for several days before
laying to make sure nothing has invaded her nesting site.

###Laying:
Finally the egg laying begins. this usually takes several hours. in my case it was 4 hours.

Once the female finishes laying and she has moved away from the nesting site, you can proceed
to dig up and remove the eggs.
