# Understanding nutrition and your Savannah Monitor’s needs
By JENIFER SOLIDA

You will see a lot of information of diet in this group, the reason being is that most of the health issues seen in captive Savannah Monitors has a nutritional related cause. In order to formulate a balanced diet it is important for understand their monitor’s nutritional needs. Nutritional needs will vary somewhat between each individual monitor, based on age, physical condition, activity levels, environment and if there is any metabolic disorders present. 

*FOOD=FUEL*

Food provides the fuel for your monitor to move, grow and repair itself. The number of calories in a food item is a measure of how much potential energy that food possesses. The number of calories your monitor requires depends on many factors including: age, body size, activity levels and environment. Food is composed of many different chemical substances:

## MACRONUTRIENTS: 
 major nutritional components that are present in relatively large amounts

* Protein: an important component of every cell in the body. Protein is used by the body to build and repair tissue. Protein is an important building block of bones, muscles, cartilage, skin and blood.
Amino acids: organic compounds made of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur

* arginine: changes into nitric acid, a powerful neurotransmitter that aids blood vessels to relax and improves circulation

* isoleucine: assists in wound healing, detoxification of nitrogen wastes, stimulates immune function, promotes secretion of hormones

* lysine: improves calcium absorption and retention, promotes wound healing 

* methionine: produces molecules critical for normal cell function. has been used to prevent liver damage in humans

* cysteine: is important of protein synthesis, detoxification, and metabolic functions

* threonine: used in biosynthesis of proteins

* tryptophan: protects against oxidation

(a gram of protein equals 4 calories)

### Lipids: 
type of organic molecule found in living things, it is oily or waxy. Lipids are the major storage form of energy for the body. They also help build cells, protect organs, air in vitamin absorption, coat nerves to provide electrical insulation, and aid in hormone production. Lipids are long chains of carbon and hydrogen molecules that can be classified as simple or complex. The four main groups of lipids are:

### Fatty acids

* Saturated fats: type of fat in which the fatty acid chains have all or predominantly single bonds. 

* Monounsaturated fats: one double bond in carbon chain

* Polyunsaturated fat: more one double bond in carbon chain

* linoleic acid: essential for growth and development, it aids the body to build muscle rather than store fat and has anti-inflammatory properties

* glycerides: triglycerides

* Nonglyceride lipids: sphingolipids, steroids, cholesterol and waxes

* Complex lipids: phospholipids and glycolipids

(no matter what type of fat it is, every gram of fat equals nine calories)
 
### Carbohydrates: 
sugars, starches and fibers found in foods. The four primary functions of carbohydrates are to provide energy, store energy, build macromolecules, and spare protein and fat for other uses. They help fuel brain function, kidney functions, liver function, cardiac muscles and central nervous system. They can also aid in digestion and balance blood cholesterol levels. There are two major types of carbohydrates, simple and complex. There are five major classifications of carbohydrates:

* Monosaccharides: glucose, fructose, galactose

* Disaccharides: sucrose, lactose

* Oligosaccharides: composed of 3-9 monosaccharides

* Polysaccharides: cellulose, starch

* Nucleotides: adenine, guanine, cytosine, thymine, uracil. ATP is a nucleotide with a adenine base and three phosphate residues.

(a gram of carbohydrates has 4 calories)

## MICRONUTRIENTS: 

a chemical element or substance required in trace amounts for the normal growth and development of a living organism. Micronutrients are vital for growth, immune function and brain development, some also play key roles in preventing and fighting disease. Micronutrients include vitamins and minerals. Vitamins are necessary for energy production, immune function and blood clotting. Minerals play an important role in growth, bone health and fluid balance. 

### TYPES AND FUNCTIONS OF MICRONUTRIENTS 

* Water-soluble vitamins: Most vitamins dissolve in water and are therefore known as water-soluble. They’re not easily stored in the body and get flushed out with urine when consumed in excess.

* Vitamin B1 (thiamine): required for the proper metabolism of starch and sugar in order to provide energy. Plays an integral role in nerve function, helps the heart and other muscles function properly

* Vitamin B2 (riboflavin): necessary for energy production. Involved in energy metabolism and helps in thyroid function. Crucial for the metabolism of fats, proteins and carbohydrates

* Vitamin B3 (niacin): drives production of energy from food. Essential for the body to convert carbohydrates and fats to energy. Aids in the normal maintenance of thyroid hormone production. Helps support normal function of the nervous system and gastrointestinal tract. Help control blood sugar. Deficits in this vitamin can lead to obesity.

* Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid): necessary for fatty acid synthesis. Helps control fat metabolism. Is needed to metabolize carbohydrates, proteins and fats, as well as produce red blood cells and steroid hormones. Aids in digestion

* Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine): helps the body release sugar from stored carbohydrates for stored energy and create red blood cells. Integral role in the metabolism of fats, and helps supply fuel to cells, which then are able to burn energy. Helps regulate thyroid function. Helps the pancreas produce enzymes that aid in digestion. 

* Vitamin B7: involved in the synthesis of fatty acids and glucose. 

* Vitamin B9 (folate): important for proper cell division, folic acid/folacin

* Vitamin B12 (cobalamin): necessary for red blood cell formation and proper nervous system and brain function.
 
* Vitamin C (ascorbic acid): required for the creation of neurotransmitters and collagen

### Fat-soluble vitamins 
do not dissolve in water. They’re best absorbed when consumed along side a source of fat. After consumption, fat soluble vitamins are stored in the liver and fatty tissues for future use. The way that these vitamins are stored is why it is vital to provide the correct amounts, if offered in excess it can lead to toxicity.

* Vitamin A: necessary for proper vision and organ function. 

* Vitamin D: promotes proper immune system function and assists in calcium absorption and bone growth

* Vitamin E: assists in immune function and acts as an antioxidant that protects cells from damage.

* Vitamin K: required for blood clotting and proper bone development

* Macro minerals are needed in larger amounts than trace minerals in order to perform their specific roles in the body. They include:

* Calcium: necessary for proper structure and function of bones and teeth, assist in muscle function and blood vessel contraction

* Phosphorus: part of bone and cell membrane structure

* Magnesium: assists with over 300 enzyme reactions, including regulation of blood pressure

* Sodium: electrolyte that aids fluid balance and maintenance of blood pressure

* Chloride: often found in combination with sodium, helps maintain fluid balance and is used to make digestive juices

* Potassium: electrolyte that maintains fluid status in cells and helps with nerve transmission and muscle function

* Sulfur: part of every living tissue and contained in the amino acids methionine  and cysteine 

* Trace minerals are needed in smaller amounts than macro minerals but still enable important functions in the body.

* Iron: helps provide oxygen to muscles and assists in the creation of certain hormones

* Manganese: assists carbohydrate, amino acids and cholesterol metabolism

* Copper: required for connective tissue formation, as well as normal brain and nervous system function

* Zinc: necessary for normal growth, immune function and wound healing

* Iodine: assists in thyroid regulation

* Fluoride: necessary for the development of teeth and bones

* Selenium: important for thyroid health, reproduction and defense against oxidative damage 

* Choline: organic, water soluble compound. It is an essential nutrient, neither vitamin or mineral. It is an important neurotransmitter for memory, mood, muscle control, and other brain and nervous system functions. A deficiency in choline can result in increased fatty deposits in the liver (fatty liver) and poor muscle coordination. It can also cause hemorrhagic kidney necrosis

The reason why gut loading is suggested is because prey fed diets lacking in nutrients, then pass on the nutrient deficiency to your monitor. By providing quality gut loading food options to prey, it can change and increase their nutrient content to make up for any imbalance that the prey itself may have.
