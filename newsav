#How to handle a new Savannah monitor

By JENIFER SOLIDA

###Acclimation

It is endorsed to use a monitor centered approach to taming. NO force handling unless medically necessary. Allow interactions to be positive and on the monitors terms.

When first obtained or moved, you will need to allow your Savannah Monitor time to acclimate to itâ€™s new surroundings as well as become used to a human presence. <b>Two weeks</b> is recommended to let your savannah monitor acclimate to his enclosure.

###live Feeding  

Feedings during the acclimation period 

 Feeders can be offered in an escape proof container. Try to keep water changes and food bowl additions on a schedule. Take a few moments out of each day to spend time near your Savannah Monitor enclosure. Some owners set up an area next to the enclosure to sit and read or scroll through their phones. This is also a good time and opportunity to learn your Savannah Monitor body language, you will then be able to easily recognize when your Savannah Monitor is relaxed/stressed/aggressive/etc. Body language can also be learned by watching videos of Savannah monitors.
 
###Body language

Some examples of body language: 

 * tongue flicking: this is good, they are smelling and investigating/curious

 * puffed up: When a Savannah Monitor puffs up it is being defensive. they like to wedge in between things and puff up so you cant get them out.

 * eyes closed: it could be sleeping but if it is an unusual time to sleep it is stressed

 * head down: could be neutral but i find my savannah monitor is stressed or accessing a situation 

 * head up: this is a good sign they are feeling confidence

 * tail whip: you are invading its space! get back!

 * hiss: a warning, not happy

 * bite: it thinks you are food, or may not like you


###Tong feeding

Once your Savannah Monitor has begun to acclimate to its new surroundings, you can begin tong feedings. Savannah Monitor are very food driven animals, by offering tong feedings you are teaching it to associate you and your presence with something that it enjoys (food).

You can also begin accessing the enclosure more often, other than feeding times. This will help teach your Savannah Monitor that you are not a threat and that interactions will not always involve food. A good way to do this is by placing your hand inside the enclosure, away from the Savannah Monitor. Just let it sit there or you can even move your palm over the substrate surface slowly, rustle leaf litter (be aware though that the movement may entice a feeding response). If you are consistent with doing this and patient, eventually your Savannah Monitor will begin to have trust enough in you to approach at first with curiosity and then with confidence.
