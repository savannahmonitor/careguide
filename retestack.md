## What is a retes stack? 

Retes Stacks are basking stacks designed by Frank Retes. They are a multi-tiered, elevated basking unit that provides a gradient of heat through various levels of hides so that the monitor can choose temperatures they prefer to bask at while being obscured.  When providing a setup like the ones endorsed by the group that offers the space for a large temperature gradient these stacks are not necessary but can be a beneficial addition for hatchlings/juveniles to aid in them feeling more secure during the acclimation period.

## CONSTRUCTION

This is a reply by Frank Retes when asked about how to construct a stack, “There is no one set thickness or design, let your imagination run wild. Also, I painted some back in 91, the paint has finally wore off.  I normally use old weathered scraps, I like them to “air out”. I have also used new wood without problem. Also, these stacks are not supposed to be stacked strait up. While thats OK, monitors really like them to be tilted up.  Say, something along a 45 degree angle. I often offer both, boards stacked flat and another stack tilted.  You also do not need thick wood.  The point is to allow a range of temps.  Thick plywood does not allow much of a range. 1/4 is perfect.  Then again, you can use thicker if you have that.  Cheers”  

Other suggestions that have been made on construction are to use 1/8-1/4 plywood squares (large enough for your monitor to enter and turn around comfortably), seperated by 1-1/2” spaces (space should be sufficient enough for your Sav to be able to stand comfortably, but tightly).  A 4 tier unit with the top surface temperature of 140F, set up properly, should have a 10-15 degree drop between each level using a single 50W halogen flood bulb.

Do not drill holes, use slate or other materials other than thin ply or provide too much space between levels as it defeats the purpose of gradient and pulls hot air through, dehydrating your monitor.
