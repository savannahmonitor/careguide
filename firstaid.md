# First Aid Kit

By JENIFER SOLIDA

 Please keep the following in a designated area so that it is easy to find during an emergency situation:

* Veterinary clinic phone number and directions

* After hours/Emergency clinic phone number and directions

* Poison control phone number

AN IMMEDIATE VETERINARY VISIT IS RECOMMENDED IF:

* Reptile is wheezing, having difficulty breathing, not breathing at all

* Reptile is non-responsive

* Reptile has a wound that will not stop bleeding

* Reptile has a large or deep wound

* Reptile is limping (after a fall)

* Reptile is constipated, or has diarrhea

* Reptile is excessively bloated, lasting more than 24hrs

* You notice the appearance of lumps, lesions or swelling anywhere on the reptile

* There is an obvious sign of infection like oozing, puss, redness or the area affected feels hot to the touch

* Reptile is lethargic

* Parasitic infection is suspected

* There is blood in the feces

* There is a prolapse

* The reptile has a seizure

* There is rapid weight loss

* There is paralysis

* There is any small injury that does not improve within 24hrs

A good idea is to have a first aid kit readily available for minor emergencies that do not require veterinary care or to aid your reptile prior to transport to a veterinary clinic. The following are items that should be kept together near the area of where your reptile is kept. Some people use plastic totes or large tool boxes to keep items organized. If you are unsure if the situation is minor or major, err on the side of caution and contact your veterinary office.

## WOUND CARE

* Sterile saline: wound flush

* Chlorhexidine diacetate (diluted .05%): wound flush

* Betadine (povidone-iodine): antiseptic flush, dilute with sterile water to the color of tea

* Triple Antibiotic ointment (without pain reliever)

* Silver Sulfadiazine cream: topical antibiotic cream for burns

* Vetericyn Plus Reptile Wound and Skin Care spray

* Eye wash solution

* Antibiotic ophthalmic ointment for eyes (terramycin)

## BANDAGING

* Square gauze

* non stick gauze pads

* first aid or paper tape: these are easier on the sensitive skin of reptiles, reduces risk of scale damage

* Vetrap: light elastic bandaging that is placed over taped gauze to help keep in place

* KeriCure or other liquid/spray bandage products: this is helpful for reptiles (like Savannah Monitors) that do not do well will traditional bandaging or if the wound is on a part of the body difficult to use traditional bandaging techniques.

* Non spermicidal condoms: great for tail injuries

* Emergency supplements

* Carnivore Care

* Liquid calcium: gluconate and glubionate

* Non flavored pedialyte: used for rehydration and dilutant
