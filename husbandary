##Nature of the Savannah Monitor 
 
Most Savannah Monitors are wild caught or farmed. Savannah Monitors native habitats include Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Bissau, Mali, Liberia, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Gambia, Guinea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, South Sudan, Togo, and Uganda.  A large portion are collected from and near Ghana Africa, located along the Gulf of Guinea and the Atlantic Ocean. Ghana is located only a few degrees north of the Equator, giving it a warm climate. Grasslands (savannah) mixed with shrublands and forest make up most of it’s landscape. The climate of Ghana is tropical and there are two main seasons: the wet season (April-mid November) and the dry season. During the wet season average temperatures range 70F-90F with relative humidity averaging between 76-100%. During the dry season average temperatures range between 70F-75F with relative average humidity between  67-80%. Understanding their natural habitat will help guide you in offering the best environment for your Savannah Monitor in captivity.

##Enclosure size

To be able to provide the most beneficial environment, the minimum housing size suggested is an 8ftx4ftx4ft sealed wood enclosure (see [“how to build an 8x4x4"](www.reddit.com/r/savannamonitor/wiki/enclosurebuild) with substrate depth of 18-24”. Vents that open/close can be installed on each side of enclosure a few inches above substrate surface to be used for additional ventilation. Though the more space you can offer, the better.  Theses monitors are often described as terrestrial but they are actually excellent climbers and are often found in tree tops during certain times of year in their natural habitat.  Adding height to the minimum suggested size would be just as beneficial as adding additional floor space. 
 
The following are just a few reasons behind the housing suggestions (from hatchling to adult):

1. A larger area is more forgiving of mistakes. It is a lot easier on new owners to learn how to regulate temperatures and humidity without negatively effecting the Savannah Monitor. Where as a smaller enclosure or fish tank poses an increased risk in overheating while trying to offer correct basking temps and diminishing humidity levels.

2. A larger enclosure will allow for deeper substrate. The deeper substrate will allow your Savannah Monitor to burrow, thermoregulate and have access to higher humidity level below ground. Being able to have access to burrows will also aid in your Savannah Monitor feeling more secure. The deeper substrate also helps with maintaining humidity levels.

3. A larger enclosure space reduces the risk of flagellate infections, as the Savannah Monitor will not be in cramped quarters with its feces.

4. A larger enclosure is more opportunity for mental stimulation. It is more space for the Savannah Monitor to explore and forage. It offers more space for “decor” such as logs/branches/limbs/plants for the Savannah Monitor to climb, move and in the case of the plants more than likely dig up.

5. Starting a Savannah Monitor in the larger enclosure size will save the owner time and money by removing the need to constantly upgrade as the monitor grows. It also saves the monitor from the added stress of reacclimating with each upgrade.

6. A larger enclosure allows for broader thermal and humidity gradients.

7. Building larger than the minimum suggested size will allow the owner to also provide a secondary basking area without overheating the enclosure, giving the Sav more basking temperature options to choose from.

##Substrate

Savannah monitors are burrowers so it is essential to provide a minimum of 18-20" inches of substrate. Substrate should be a mixture of 40/60 washed playsand and fertilizer/additive free soil. Peat moss is also recommended, as it helps keep moisture.

An excerpt from Savannahmonitor.net: “Savannah Monitors are very intelligent animals, they require stimulation, locked inside four walls with nothing to do is comparable to solitary confinement in a prison. They NEED space, they NEED dirt to dig burrows in. Like a child in a sand box, nothing else you can do for your animal is better than to give it plenty of sandy soil mix to tunnel in and providing enrichment to keep the animal’s mind keen. Monitors in captivity can become bored (wouldn’t you be in a box)”.

##UVB

Something that is often ignored and not always agreed upon is the use of UVB. Due to the risk of metabolic bone issues and D3 toxicity, I do encourage owners to utilize UVB in Savannah Monitor housing. When using UVB lighting, feeders should be dusted with a Calcium only supplement. Ghana has a very high UVB index, so I do suggest using T5 or T8 UVB bulbs/fixtures. Brands that I suggest are Reptisun 10.0 T5 HO or T8 UVB bulbs or Arcadia D3+12% or D3+HO t5 14% UVB bulbs. Mount center of ceiling cage for maximum exposure. Some owners also use mercury vapor and metal halide UVB bulbs, both offer UVB, UVA and heat all in one.

##Basking

Savannah Monitors require higher basking and ambient (air) temperatures, not only to replicated their natural environment but to aid in digestion as well. The best way to offer your Savannah Monitor the correct basking temperatures and reduce the risk of burns is to provide a large basking area with a multi-fixtured rowed lighting setup over head, using low wattage bulbs (3-4 fixtures, 50-75w halogen flood bulbs). To be able to accurately measure the basking surface temperature you are providing, a laser (infared) temperature gun should be used. You need to offer a range of basking surface temperatures between 130F-160F.

##Temperatures & Humidity:

To be able to accurately measure ambient (air) temperatures is to use a digital thermometer. You need to keep your cool side ambient temperatures in the range between 75F-80F, hot side 90F-100F.
To be able to accurately measure your humidity levels is to use a digital hygrometer, humidity should be offered in varying levels above 65%.  Keeping humidity levels consistently in the high range or consistently in the low range can lead to health issues for your monitor.  If you would like to more closely replicated their natural environment, following Accra Ghana daily humidity is an easy way for owners to do so. Helpful hint: I have found an easier way to monitor the ambient temperatures and humidity levels is to invest in two 2n1 digital hygrometer/thermometer units, mounting one on each end of the enclosure a few inches above substrate level. They can be purchased at most local retail stores as well as online.

##Water dish & Hides
 
A savannah monitor requires a variety of hides that conceal its entire body and allow it to turn around when inside. Hides help savannah monitors feel secure.

A water dish in which the monitor can fully soak is also essential. Keep it in the cooler portion of the terrarium. A popular item used are plastic cat litter tubs.

Some savannah monitors will poop in their water dishes. This can be a sign of intestinal parasites, dehydration, or just lack of space. Your savannah monitor may form a habit in pooping in their water dish. They deserve little toilets.
 
A separate, perhaps smaller water dish for clean drinking water is ideal. Place a stone in the dish to keep your monitor from using it as a toilet.

##Enrichment:

* Adding leaf litter will stimulate your savannah monitors senses. 

* Savannah monitors will climb if offered some branches but mostly prefer to burrow. 

* By digging and climbing they will naturally dull their claws so you do not need to trim them.

* Moss and plants will help keep humidity but your savannah monitor may trample or destroy them.

* Retes stacks are great, and so are paving stones for basking spots.

* Provide plenty of hides and cover for them to feel safe!

##NOTE: On fish tanks, exoterras, and repti habitats

99.9% of health problems faced by captive Savannah Monitors are husbandry related; how they are cared for, environment and diet. With hatchling and juvenile Savannah Monitors it is more often environmental factors. This is a critical time for the monitors, the more damage done during this time the longer lasting the negative affects are long term. It is imperative to offer a beneficial environment from the start. Fish tanks, exoterras, repti habitats are not going to be able to provide the most beneficial environment possible and their use should be strictly limited (even with modifications).
