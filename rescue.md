# Rescue Savannah Monitor care advice
 By JENIFER SOLIDA

## WHY YOU SHOULD RESCUE

Instead of providing the demand for WC Savannah Monitors and their irresponsible mass importation by purchasing from vendors, pet stores and online sites, you will often see the suggestion of obtaining a rescue Savannah Monitor.  

Savannah Monitors already have great difficulty in captivity, all dying a premature death, but rescues are even more of a challenge.  They often come with an array of health and temperatment issues.  They usually require more vet care and more costly medical treatments.  They require more work, time and patience than the average healthy Savannah Monitor, which is already quite a job.  You will more than likely make a large investment into a Savannah Monitor that had an already shortened lifespan shortened even more so.  

I am not saying any of this to deter people from taking in a rescue but a potential owner needs to be prepared for this, needs to know the reality of things so that they can make an informed decision that in turn will be the best choice for the monitor.  It is a selfless decision. See why we [shouldn't support the pet trade](https://github.com/savannahmonitor/careguide/blob/main/stopsupplyanddemand.md) for more information.

## THINGS THAT NEED TO BE DONE WHEN BRINGING HOME A RESCUE 

* an enclosure 
* vet appointment

It is of great importance that you provide a beneficial environment for your rescue from the time you bring it home. If you cannot, a temporary enclosure in a plant tent is recommended. 

Set up an appointment with a knowledgeable exotics veterinarian for a well check, fecal testing and blood chemistry panel.  Please advise office staff when making the appointment, and have it notated that your Savannah Monitor is a rescue.

Plan for extra veterinary expenses, for regular well checks, diagnostics and treatments.

## ACCLIMATION

It is endorsed to use a monitor centered approach to taming. NO force handling unless medically necessary. Allow interactions to be positive and on the monitors terms.

When first obtained or moved, you will need to allow your Savannah Monitor time to acclimate to it’s new surroundings as well as become used to a human presence. <b>Two weeks</b> is recommended to let your savannah monitor acclimate to his enclosure.

## TEMPERAMENT 

Many people surrender their savannah monitor because they could not provide enclosure size, food demand, but mostly for temperament. Savannah monitors are very shy and naturally solitude. A sick savannah, from maybe an improper diet or enclosure, may be even more stressed. 

If your rescue is biting, hissing, and tail whipping, it is severely stressed. Only force handling for the vet, and wear gloves to avoid bites. Be gentle, be sure to lure with food before force handling. Again, forced handling is a last resort only if you need to handle your monitor to get to the vet.

You will need to be very patient. After following the acclimation guide, if your savannah is very aggressive it is suggested to wear gloves. If your monitor bites you, hisses, or tail whips, it is important not to react. If you react, you reinforce its bad behavior. Wearing gloves prevents you from being harmed, and reacting to bites. By tong feeding your savannah will learn the difference between you and food. Remember to keep your hands clean, especially if you have been handling food, or anything else that could trigger a response.

## COMMON CONDITIONS SEEN WITH RESCUES

### OBESITY: 
Obesity is one of the most common condition seen with rescue Savannah Monitors. Reducing weight should be done cautiously and gradually. This is one of the reasons blood work is so important in the beginning, this way you can be made aware of any deficits in liver or kidney functions. Reducing weight too quickly or with prolonged periods of ceased feedings can actually exacerbate existing organ issues.  Ways to help your Sav gradually decrease weight are:

* offering sufficient heat to increase metabolism, large basking area 130-160F basking surface 

* temperature range measured by an infrared temp gun

* Varying humidity levels above 65%

* Larger space for excercise and movement

* Reduced sized meals with low fat/low calorie options like earthworms, nightcrawlers and roaches

* 3 fasting days between meals (for adult rescues)

Make your monitor work for every meal. Good ways to do this is playing a game of chase the tong, placing a feeder in the tong and making your Sav run and climb to be able to be rewarded with the feeder and/or releasing feeders into the enclosure for foraging.

### MBD AND/OR HYPOCALCEMIA: 

COMMON CAUSES

* Lack of UVB exposure

* Diet

SYMPTOMS

* Limping

* Bowed legs 

* Hard lumps along the legs, spinal column or jaw

* Softening and unusual flexibility of lower jaw (also referred to as “rubber jaw”)

* Bone malformation of cranial structure

* Bone fragility resulting from reduction in bone mass and density

DIAGNOSIS

* Clinical signs

* Blood work

* X-rays

TREATMENT OPTIONS

* For severe cases: IV calcium glubionate, calcium injections, vitamin D injections, oral supplements and fluid therapy

* For mild cases: dietary improvement, calcium and vitamin D supplements, access to UVB lighting 

Either treatment option can stop progression but it cannot reverse the damage already done.  You will need to modify your enclosure to reduce risk of falls and damage to fragile bones. 

### DEHYDRATION

COMMON CAUSES

* Inadequate drinking water

* Low humidity

* High temperatures

* Poor diet

* Infection

* Chronic disease


SYMPTOMS

* Sunken eyes

* Dry or tacky (sometimes pale) mucous membranes

* Wrinkled skin

* Difficulty shedding

* Lethargy

DIAGNOSIS

* Blood panel: elevated uric acid levels, elevated packed cell volumes, total protein values

There are 3 types of dehydration

* Hypertonic dehydration: common with reptiles with limited access to water or do not drink.

* Isotonic dehydration: common result of diarrhea and short-term anorexia

* Hypotonic dehydration is commonly caused by long term anorexia

TREATMENT

* Treatment for severe dehydration: fluids administered subcutaneous (under the skin), intracoelomic ( directly into the 
coelomic cavity), intra0sseus (in bone) or intravenous (vein).

* Treatment for mild dehydration: orally administered fluids

Once your Savannah Monitor is sufficiently rehydrated, you will want to make sure that you are offering fresh water daily, add higher moisture content feeders to your Savs diet and make sure that you are maintaining higher humidity levels so that your Sav will stay hydrated.

### RENAL DISEASE

COMMON CAUSES

* Low humidity

* Long term water deprivation

* Chronic dehydration

* High Protein Diet

* Excess vitamin D supplementation

SYMPTOMS

* Lethargy

* Weakness

* Signs of dehydration (see above)

* Cessation of urate output

* Anorexia

* Weight gain and weight loss

* Increased drinking

DIAGNOSIS

* Physical exam

* Blood panel (elevated uric acid levels)

* X-ray 

* Endoscopy

TREATMENT

* Hydration

* Address underlying husbandry cause

* Medications to reduce uric acid levels

*Long term supportive care (medications and supplements)

### GOUT

COMMON CAUSES

* High protein diet

* Chronic dehydration

* Renal issues

SYMPTOMS

* Swollen and painful joints (you may see the Sav reluctant to move or having mobility issues)

* Mucous membranes may have visible bumps, which is called tophi


DIAGNOSIS

* Physical

* Blood panel

* X-ray

TREATMENT

* Dietary modification

* Hydration therapy

* Pain management

* Medication to reduce uric acid

* Surgery
