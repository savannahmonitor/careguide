#Studies on natural diet 

(stomach contents of Varanus Exanthematicus)

One of the biggest debates in the Savannah Monitor community has been diet of both what captives should be offered and what wild specimens consume.  This file is going to cover what has been consistently found in wild specimens stomach contents.

Cisse, M. Bulletin de L’institute Fondamental d’Afrique Noire. 1972 34(2):503-515. The diet of Varanids in Senegal.  
These are the results from Cisse’s study of stomach content:

* Millipedes, 48.32%

* Insects, 45.49%. This consisted of the following:

* Coleopterids, 21.22%

* Lepidoterans (chenilles), 15.21%

* Orthopterans, 8.84%

The remaining food types included:

* Eggs of Agama and V. Exanthematicus, 3.75%

* Mollusks, 2.35%

Varanus Exanthematicus: 
“Beetles, millipedes, caterpillars and orthopterans were the most important items in 24 stomachs from Senegal; three had eaten lizard eggs, including one that contained 11 V. Exanthematicus eggs. Other prey were snails, centipedes, a hymenopteran and a scorpion. The lizards tended to eat many items (1-105/stomach, x=35.3), and many of a particular type. For lizards that had eaten a particular prey, the mean numer of millipedes was 29.1, of bettles 10.0, of orthopterans 9.4 and of lizard eggs 10.7 (Cisse, 1972).  Insects predominated in ten specimens we examined. More than half had eaten beetles, and they were the only type eaten by more than two individuals.  Snails and lepidopteran larvae were also important items by number. The only vertebrates were eaten by small monitors; a 42.4g V. Exanthematicus ate a 7.4g ranid frog (MR=0.1745) and a 147g specimen took a 13.4g Bufo sp. (MR=0.0912).  All large specimens contained only relatively small invertebrates.  One 1.31kg specimen contained 35 lepidopteran larvae, ranging from 0.7 to 3.0g (MR=0.0020), a 1,9g beetle (MR=0.0015) and a reptile egg.  A 1.47kg specimen contained four beetles, the largest weighing 2.9g (MR=0.0020).  The range in items per stomach was great; two individuals had more than 30 items and three other specimens contained four or more items.
