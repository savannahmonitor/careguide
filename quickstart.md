#Quickstart guide!


* Minimum 8x4x4 sealed enclosure

* Minimum 18"-2ft sand/soil substrate

* UVB lighting

* Basking surface temp measured by laser temp gun 130-160F

* Cool side ambient temps measured digitally 75F-80F

* Hot side ambient temps measured digitally 90F-100F

* Humidity varying range above 65%

* Soaking dish and hides

* Arthropod/invert based diet, dusted with calcium

* Veterinary testing

 
8x4x4 is minimum requirements for enclosure size. Build as large as you can. You want to seal the wood to deter rotting and keep humidity in. Proper substrate of 40/60 sand/soil and the depth to allow your savannah monitor to burrow, as they are a burrowing species.

We do not endorse anything smaller or aquarium tanks as they are not suitable. Most people will have to build their own enclosure. While you prepare the proper enclosure, a plant tent or the largest tote you can find may be suitable for a short period of time.

Savannah monitors are cold blooded and have to thermoregulate themselves from heat sources. It is required to have a cool side and hot side with a basking spot to keep your savannah monitor healthy. Of course, you should have your lights set up to simulate day and night. An lightless heat lamp can help keep ambient and night time temps warm. Do not use red lights.

Humidity is easily achieved with a spray bottle/mister. Keeping humidity is also achieved with moss, leaf litter, logs, a proper enclosure (not all glass), and any plants that can survive. A fogger or misting system is just not needed (unless your climate calls for it) as they can easily get a respiratory infection from too much humidity.

(note about plants: your savannah will probably trample them, or they will die without fertilizer. some people have had luck planting a plant that is potted into their enclosure keeping the fertilizer dirt separate.  

Savannah monitors need drinking water and a soaking dish. Commonly used for soaking tubs are cat litter boxes, dog bowls, or tupperware. Plastic is easy to clean and move.
 
Do not bathe your savannah monitor. This is very popular advice for shed or constipation but is not endorsed by experienced owners for health reasons. Savannah monitors are burrowers and often soak in puddles. In their natural habitat they live near the nile river, but are ABSOLUTELY terrified because, guess what, it is full of predators! Their intuition of this will stress them out. HOWEVER, it is advised to soak a savannah monitor in a tub if it is for healing a burn wound. 

Savannah monitors need places to hide to feel secure. They are often preyed upon in the wild. Do not grab your savannah from above, as this simulates a bird of prey. If you can, have your enclosure with a side entrance. 

Savannah monitors eat an arthropod based diet. Keep in mind that these animals are simply not designed to digest large quantities of fur and fat, and the constraints of a captive lifestyle can only compound potential issues. Dust feeders with calcium.

Always take your new pet to the vet. 99% of Savannah monitors are wild caught. That means they have been through the stress of transportation and have a high risk of having parasites from the wild.
