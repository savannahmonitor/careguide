## GAUGES

* INFARED TEMPERATURE GUN: An infared temp gun measures surface temperatures accurately and efficiently. This is a much needed tool to determine basking and substrate surface temperatures. *You cannot accurately measure air temperatures with this tool.

* DIGITAL 2N1 THERMOMETER/HYGROMETER: 
A thermometer measures ambient (air) ambient temperatures. A hygrometer measures the amount of humidity in the air. Using digital gives a much more accurate reading than analog. Something I have found to make monitoring interior enclosure conditions is to purchase two digital 2n1 thermometer/hygrometers and mount them on each end of the enclosure (mounting on cool end approximately 6 inches above substrate surface. On the hot end mounting just outside basking area approximately 6 inches above substrate surface). *You cannot accurate measure surface temperatures with these gauges.

## LIGHTING

* BASKING LIGHTING: to avoid burns and offer a larger heated area that will provide full coverage of your monitor, provide 3-4 fixures using low wattage flood bulbs. 

* Halogen Flood Bulbs 65-75W. Par38s are one of the more durable options. Never use spot lighting bulbs as these put off a narrow beam that limit heated space and increase risk of burns. If choosing this option, you will need to offer a seperate source of UVB lighting.

* Daylight Basking Reptile flood type bulbs (75W). If using this option, you will need to offer a seperate source of UVB lighting.

* Mercury Vapor Bulb (MVB) (Mega Ray 70W, Exo terra solar Glo all in one 80W, Zoo Med Powersun 80W) These bulbs provide both heat and UVB.

## UVB LIGHTING: 

Savannah Monitors come from areas with high UV indexes. They are a diurnal species, so they are exposed to high levels of UVB in the wild. We suggest offering the same in captivity to better support your monitor and ensure there are no nutritional deficits that can lead to illness or disease, UVB helps your monitor metabolize calcium properly. By using T5 High Output UVB bulbs, it provides a higher percentage of UVB but these bulbs only need to be replaced every 12 months (vs T8 UVB that have a lower output and need to be replaced every 6 months). For 8x4x4 or larger enclosures 36-48” fixture/bulb are recommended.

* Zoo Med Reptisun T5 HO 10.0, hood and bulb 36-48”

* Arcadia D3+HO T5 14% UVB, fixture and bulb 36-48”

## BUILD MATERIALS

* WOOD: There are different types of woods that can be used to build your Savannah Monitor enclosure. It is a good idea to avoid wood types that are toxic to reptiles even when the wood used will be sealed. Unsafe woods include: Cedar, Eucalyptus, Chemically treated wood, Raw Pine. The wood commonly used for construction is plywood (plywood made of pine is generally kiln dried which makes it a safe option for reptiles) and 2x2, 1x2, 2x4 white wood lumber.  

* Wood SEALANT OPTIONS: Pond armor, fiberglass resin or lining wood with Fiber Reinforced Plastic (FRP) are the longest lasting sealing options. 100% silicone (without mold inhibitors) to seal seams, joints, over nail/screw heads. 

* ENCLOSURE OPENINGS/ACCESS: 
Common options are plexiglass sheets (these are a safe option, however they may need to be replaced over time since monitor nails/scratching will begin to show on the plexi), thick glass sheets, repurposed house window (this is the choice I prefer. They can usually be found cheaply on FB resale sites or resale stores like Habitat for Humanity, they are durable, easy to frame out and install, and they seal efficiently). The Plexiglass sheets can be framed out and attached to enclosure by heavy duty hinges for a swing open option. Personally I am not a fan of this option, sometimes it can be difficult for novice builders to get the opening just right so it seals to avoid escapes, also if it is a full front or larger opening this option can be cumbersome (and more difficult to close quickly to stop your Sav if it decides to try and launch out). Glass sheets should be installed using tracks, as can the plexiglass sheeting, specifically made for sliding glass or aluminum U channels can be used as tracks as well. 

## ADDITIONAL SUPPLIES:
* SUBSTRATE: The recommended substrate is 18-24” of substrate. The common substrate types used is a mix of washed playsand and additive free topsoil (make sure that it contains no additives and that it is topsoil or garden soil NOT potting soil). The mixture ratio is 30/70 or 40/60 sand/soil.

* CLIMBING OPPORTUNITIES: Branches from reptile safe wood (solid), mounted and secured both vertically and horizontally in the enclosure. Branches can be collected from outdoors as long as the area has not been exposed to chemicals. If they are fresh cut it is a good idea to allow them to dry out before using them in the enclosure. If they are branches that have fallen, it is a good idea to knock them around a bit to make sure there are no unwanted “hitchhikers” likes ants within the wood. Line walls with sealed wooden latice. Install ramps and shelves along interior walls.
